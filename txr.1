.TH txr 1 2009-11-15 "txr v. 021" "Text Extraction Utility"
.SH NAME
txr \- text extractor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B txr [ options ] query-file { data-file }*
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B txr
is a query tool for extracting pieces of text buried in one or more text
file based on pattern matching.  A
.B txr
query specifies a pattern which matches (a prefix of) entire file, or
multiple files. The pattern is matched against the material in the files, and
free variables occurring in the pattern are bound to the pieces of text
occurring in the corresponding positions. If the overall match is
successful, then
.B txr
can do one of two things: it can report the list of variables which were bound,
in the form of a set of variable assignments which can be evaluated by the
.B eval
command of the POSIX shell language, or generate a custom report according
to special directives in the query.

In addition to embedded variables which implicitly match text, the
.B txr
query language supports a number of directives, for matching text using regular
expressions, for continuing a match in another file, for searching through a
file for the place where an entire sub-query matches, for collecting lists, and
for combining sub-queries using logical conjunction, disjunction and negation.

When
.B txr
finds a match for a variable and binds it, if that variable occurs again
later in the query, the variable's text is substituted, forcing a match for
that exact text. Thus txr supports a rudimentary form of backreferencing
unification, if you will. For example, the query

  @FOO=@FOO

will match material from the start of the line until the first equal sign,
and bind it to the variable
.IR FOO.
Then, the material which follows the equal sign to the end of the line must
match the contents bound to FOO. Hence the line "abc=abc" will match, but
"abc=xyz" will fail to match.

Generally, the scope of a variable's binding
extends from its first successful match where the binding is established, to
the end of the query. Unsuccessful subqueries have no effect on the
bindings.  Even if a failed subquery is partially successful, all of its
bindings are thrown away.  Some directives treat the bindings emanating
from their subqueries in special ways.

.SH ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS

Options which don't take an argument may be combined together.
The -v and -q options are mutually exclusive. Of these two, the one which
occurs in the rightmost position in the argument list dominates.
The -c and -f options are also mutually exclusive; if both are specified,
it is a fatal error.

.IP -Dvar=value
Bind the variable
.IR var
to the value
.IR value
prior to processing the query. The name is in scope over the entire
query, so that all occurrence of the variable are substituted and
match the equivalent text.  If the value contains commas, these
are interpreted as separators, which give rise to a list value.
For instance -Da,b,c creates a list of the strings "a", "b" and "c".
(See Collect Directive bellow). List variables provide a multiple
match. That is to say, if a list variable occurs in a query, a successful
match occurs if any of its values matches the text. If more than one
value matches the text, the first one is taken.

.IP -Dvar
Binds the variable
.IR var
to an empty string value prior to processing the query.

.IP -q
Quiet operation during matching. Certain error messages are not reported on the
standard error device (but the if the situations occur, they still fail the
query). This option does not suppress error generation during the parsing
of the query, only during its execution.

.IP -v
Verbose operation. Detailed logging is enabled.

.IP -b
Suppresses the printing of variable bindings for a successful query, and the
word .IR false for a failed query. The program still sets an appropriate
termination status.

.IP -a num
Specifies the maximum number of array dimensions to use for variables
arising out of collect. The default is 1. Additional dimensions are
expressed using numeric suffixes in the generated variable names.
For instance, consider the three-dimensional list arising out of a triply
nested collect: ((("a" "b") ("c" "d")) (("e" "f") ("g" "h"))).
Suppose this is bound to a variable V.  With -a 1, this will be
reported as:

  V_0_0[0]="a"
  V_0_1[0]="b"
  V_1_0[0]="c"
  V_1_1[0]="d"
  V_0_0[1]="e"
  V_0_1[1]="f"
  V_1_0[1]="g"
  V_1_1[1]="h"

The leftmost bracketed index is the most major index. That is to say,
the dimension order is: NAME_m_m+1_..._n[1][2]...[m-1].

.IP -c query
Specifies the query in the form of a command line argument. If this option is
used, the query-file argument is omitted. The first non-option argument,
if there is one, now specifies the first input source rather than a query.
Unlike queries read from a file, (non-empty) queries specified as arguments
using -c do not have to properly end in a newline. Internally, txr
adds the missing newline before parsing the query. Thus -c "@a"
is a valid query which matches a line.

Example:

  # read two lines "1" and "2" from standard input,
  # binding them to variables a and b. Standard
  # input is specified as - and the data
  # comes from shell "here document" redirection.

  txr -c "@a
  @b" - <<!
  1
  2
  !

  Output:
  a=1
  b=2

The @# comment syntax can be used for better formatting:

  txr -c "@#
  @a
  @b"

.IP -f query-file
Specifies the file from which the query is to be read, instead of the
query-file argument. This is useful in #! scripts. (See Hash Bang Support
below).

.IP --help
Prints usage summary on standard output, and terminates successfully.

.IP --version
Prints program version standard output, and terminates successfully.

.IP --
Signifies the end of the option list. This option does not combine with others, so for instance -b- does not mean -b --, but is an error.

.IP -
This argument is not interpreted as an option, but treated as a filename
argument. After the first such argument, no more options are recognized. Even
if another argument looks like an option, it is treated as a name.
This special argument - means "read from standard input" instead of a file.
The query file, or any of the data files, may be specified using this option.
If two or more files are specified as -, the behavior is system-dependent.
It may be possible to indicate EOF from the interactive terminal, and
then specify more input which is interpreted as the second file, and so forth.

.PP
After the options, the remaining arguments are files. The first file argument
specifies the query, and is mandatory.  A file argument consisting of a single
- means to read the standard input instead of opening a file. A file argument
which begins with an exclamation symbol means that the rest of the argument is
a shell command which is to be run as a coprocess, and its output read like a
file.

.PP
.B txr
begins by reading the query. The entire query is scanned, internalized
and then begins executing.  No file is opened until the query calls for a match
for material from that file, but once opened, a file is always read in its
entirety and stored in memory. A query may complete (successfully or not)
before opening some or all of the files.

If no files arguments are specified on the command line, it is up to the
query to open a file, pipe or standard input via the @(next) directive
prior to attempting to make a match. If a query attempts to match text,
but has run out of files to process, the match fails.

.SH STATUS AND ERROR REPORTING
.B txr
sends errors and verbose logs to the standard error device.  The following paragraphs apply when
.B txr
is run without enabling verbose mode. If verbose mode is enabled, then
.B txr
issues diagnostics on the standard error device even in situations which are
not erroneous.

If the command line arguments are incorrect, or the query has a malformed
syntax, or fails to match,
.B txr
issues an error diagnostic and terminates with a failed status.

If the query is accepted, but fails to execute, either due to a
semantic error or due to a mismatch against the data,
.B txr
terminates with a failed status, it also prints the word
.IR false
on standard output. (See NOTES ON FALSE below).  Printing of false
is suppressed if the query executed one or more @(output) directive
directed to standard output.

If the query is well-formed, and matches, then
.B txr
issues no diagnostics on standard error (except in the case of verbose
reporting enabled by -v).  If no variables were bound in the query, then
nothing is printed on standard output.  If the query has matched one or more
variables, then these variables are printed on standard output, in the form of
a shell script which, when evaluated, will cause shell variables to be
assigned.  Printing of these variables is suppressed if the query executed one
or more @(output) directive directed to standard output.

.SH BASIC QUERY SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS

.SS Comments

A query may contain comments which are delimited by the sequence @# and
extend to the end of the line. No whitespace can occur between the @ and #.
A comment which begins on a line swallows that entire line, as well as the
newline which terminates it. In essence, the entire comment disappears.
If the comment follows some material in a line, then it does not consume
the newline. Thus, the following two queries are equivalent:

 1.  @a@# comment: match whole line against variable @a
     @# this comment disappears entirely
     @b

 2.  @a
     @b

The comment after the @a does not consume the newline, but the
comment which follows does. Without this intuitive behavior,
line comment would give rise to empty lines that must match empty
lines in the data, leading to spurious mismatches.

.SS Hash Bang Support

If the first line of a query begins with the characters #!,
that entire line is deleted from the query. This allows
for txr queries to be turned into standalone executable programs in the POSIX
environment.

Shell example: create a simple executable program called "twoline.txr" and
run it. This assumes txr is installed in /usr/bin.

  $ cat > twoline.txr
  #!/usr/bin/txr
  @a
  @b
  [Ctrl-D]
  $ chmod a+x twoline.txr
  $ ./twoline.txr -
  1
  2
  [Ctrl-D]
  a=1
  b=2

A script written in this manner will not pass options to txr.  For
instance, if the above script is invoked like this

  ./twoline.txr -Da=42

the -D option isn't passed down to txr; -Da=42 is an ordinary
argument (which the script will try to open as an input file).
This behavior is useful if the script author wants not to
expose the txr options to the user of the script.

However, if the hash bang line can use the -f option:

  #!/usr/bin/txr -f

Now, the name of the script is passed as an argument to the -f option,
and txr will look for more options after that.

.SS Text

Query material which is not escaped by the special character @ is
literal text, which matches input character for character. Text which occurs at
the beginning of a line matches the beginning of a line.  Text which starts in
the middle of a line, other than following a variable, must match exactly at
the current position, where the previous match left off. Moreover, if the text
is the last element in the line, its match is anchored to the end of the line.

The semantics of text matching next to a variable is discussed in the following
section.

A query may not leave unmatched material in a line which is covered by the
query.  However, a query may leave unmatched lines.

In the following example, the query matches the text, even though
the text has an extra line.

 Query:         Four score and seven
                years ago our

 Text:          Four score and seven
                years ago our
                forefathers

In the following example, the query
.B fails
to match the text, because the text has extra material on one
line.

 Query:         I can carry nearly eighty gigs
                in my head

 Text:          I can carry nearly eighty gigs of data
                in my head

Needless to say, if the text has insufficient material relative
to the query, that is a failure also.

To match arbitrary material from the current position to the end
of a line, the "match any sequence of characters, including empty"
regular expression @/.*/ can be used. Example:

 Query:         I can carry nearly eighty gigs@/.*/

 Text:          I can carry nearly eighty gigs of data

In this example, the query matches, since the regular expression
matches the string "of data". (See Regular Expressions section below).

.SS Special Characters in Text

Control characters may be embedded directly in a query (with the exception of
newline characters). An alternative to embedding is to use escape syntax.
The following escapes are supported:

.IP @\ea
Alert character (ASCII 7, BEL).
.IP @\eb
Backspace (ASCII 8, BS).
.IP @\et
Horizontal tab (ASCII 9, HT).
.IP @\en
Line feed (ASCII 10, LF). Serves as abstract newline on POSIX systems.
.IP @\ev
Vertical tab (ASCII 11, VT).
.IP @\ef
Form feed (ASCII 12, FF). This character clears the screen on many
kinds of terminals, or ejects a page of text from a line printer.
.IP @\er
Carriage return (ASCII 13, CR).
.IP @\ee
Escape (ASCII 27, ESC)
.IP @\exHEX
A @\ex followed by a sequence of hex digits is interpreted as a hexadecimal
numeric character code. For instance @\ex41 is the ASCII character A.
.IP @\eOCTAL
A @\e followed by a sequence of octal digits (0 through 7) is interpreted
as an octal character code. For instance @\e010 is character 8, same as @\eb.
.PP

Note that if a newline is embedded into a query line with @\en, this
does not split the line into two; it's embedded into the line and
thus cannot match anything. However, @\en may be useful in the @(cat)
directive and in @(output).

.SS International Characters

.B txr
represents text internally using wide characters, which are used to represent
Unicode code points. The query language, as well as all data sources, are
assumed to be in the UTF-8 encoding.  In the query language, extended
characters can be used directly in comments, literal text, string literals,
quasiliterals and regular expressions.  Extended characters can also be
expressed indirectly using hexadecimal or octal escapes.
On some platforms, wide characters may be restricted to 16 bits, so that
.B txr
can only work with characters in the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)
subset of Unicode.

If
.B txr
encounters an invalid bytes in the UTF-8 input, what happens depends on the
context in which this occurs. Invalid bytes in a query are reported as errors.
Invalid bytes in data are currently treated in an unspecified way. In
the future, invalid bytes in data will be mapped to the Unicode codes
U+DC00 through U+DCFF.

.SS Variables

Much of the query syntax consists of arbitrary text, which matches file data
character for character. Embedded within the query may be variables and
directives which are introduced by a @ character.  Two consecutive @@
characters encode a literal @.

A variable matching or substitution directive is written in one of several
ways:

  @NAME
  @{NAME}
  @*NAME
  @*{NAME}
  @{NAME /RE/}
  @{NAME NUMBER}

The forms with an * indicate a long match, see Longest Match below.
The last two forms with the embedded regexp /RE/ or number have special
semantics, see Positive Match below.

The name itself may consist of any combination of one or more letters, numbers,
and underscores, and must begin with a letter or underscore.  Case is
sensitive, so that @FOO is different from @foo, which is different from @Foo.
The braces around a name can be used when material which follows would
otherwise be interpreted as being part of the name. For instance @FOO_bar
introduces the name "FOO_bar", whereas @{FOO}_bar means the variable named
"FOO" followed by the text "_bar".   There may be whitespace between the @ and
the name, or opening brace. Whitespace is also allowed in the interior of the
braces. It is not significant.

If a variable has no prior binding, then it specifies a match. The
match is determined from some current position in the data: the
character which immediately follows all that has been matched previously.
If a variable occurs at the start of a line, it matches some text
at the start of the line. If it occurs at the end of a line, it matches
everything from the current position to the end of the line.

The extent of the matched text (the text bound to the variable) is determined
by looking at what follows the variable.  A variable may be followed by a piece
of text, a regular expression directive, another variable, or nothing (i.e.
occurs at the end of a line).

If the variable is followed by nothing, the
match extends from the current position in the data, to the end of the line.
Example:

  pattern:      "a b c @FOO"
  data:         "a b c defghijk"
  result:       FOO="defghijk"

If the variable is followed by text (all non-directive material extending to
the end of the line, or to the start of another directive), then the extent of
the match is determined by searching for the first occurrence of that text
within the line, starting at the current position. The variable matches
everything between the current position and the matching position (not
including the matching position). Any whitespace which follows the
variable (and is not enclosed inside braces that surround the variable
name) is part of the text. For example:

  pattern:      "a b @FOO e f"
  data:         "a b c d e f"
  result:       FOO="c d"

In the above example, the pattern text "a b " matches the
data "a b ". So when the @FOO variable is processed, the data being
matched is the remaining "c d e f". The text which follows @FOO
is " e f". This is found within the data "c d e f" at position 3
(counting from 0).  So positions 0-2 ("c d") constitute the matching
text which is bound to FOO.

If the variable is followed by a regular expression directive,
the extent is determined by finding the closest match for the
regular expression. (See Regular Expressions section below).

.SS Consecutive Variables

If an unbound variable is followed by another unbound variable, the
combination is a semantic error which will fail the query. A
diagnostic message will be issued, unless operating in quiet mode via -q.
The reason is that there is no way to bind two consecutive variables to
an extent of text; this is an ambiguous situation, since there is no
matching criterion for dividing the text between two variables.
(In theory, a repetition of the same variable, like @FOO@FOO, could
find a solution by dividing the match extent in half, which would work
only in the case when it contains an even number of characters.
This behavior seems to have dubious value).

An unbound variable may be followed by one which is bound. The bound
variable is replaced by the text which it denotes, and the logic proceeds
accordingly.  Variables are never bound to regular expressions, so
the regular expression match does not arise in this case.
The @* syntax for longest match is available. Example:

  pattern:      "@FOO:@BAR@FOO"
  data:         "xyz:defxyz"
  result:       FOO=xyz, BAR=def

Here, FOO is matched with "xyz", based on the delimiting around the
colon. The colon in the pattern then matches the colon in the data,
so that BAR is considered for matching against "defxyz".
BAR is followed by FOO, which is already bound to "xyz".
Thus "xyz" is located in the "defxyz" data following "def",
and so BAR is bound to "def".

If an unbound variable is followed by a variable which is bound to a list, or
nested list, then each character string in the list is tried in turn to produce
a match. The first match is taken.

.SS Longest Match

The closest-match behavior for text and regular expressions can be
overridden to longest match behavior. A special syntax is provided
for this: an asterisk between the @ and the variable, e.g:

  pattern:      "a @*{FOO}cd"
  data:         "a b cdcdcdcd"
  result:       FOO="b cdcdcd"

  pattern:      "a @{FOO}cd"
  data:         "a b cdcdcd"
  result:       FOO="b "

In the former example, the match extends to the rightmost occurrence of "cd",
and so FOO receives "b cdcdcd".  In the latter example, the *
syntax isn't used, and so a leftmost match takes place. The extent
covers only the "b ", stopping at the first "cd" occurrence.

.SS Positive Match

The syntax variants

 @{NAME /RE/}
 @{NAME NUMBER}

specify a variable binding that is driven by a positive match derived
from a regular expression or character count, rather than from trailing
material (which may be regarded as a "negative" match, since the variable is
bound to material which is
.B skipped
in order to match the trailing material). In the /RE/ form, the match
extends over all characters from the current position which match
the regular expression RE.

In the NUMBER form, the match processes a field of text which
consists of the specified number of characters, which must be nonnegative
number.  If the data line doesn't have that many characters starting at the
current position, the match fails. A match for zero characters produces an
empty string.  The text which is actually matched by this construct
is all text within the specified field, but excluding leading and
trailing whitespace. If the field contains only spaces, then an empty
string is extracted.

A number is made up of digits, optionally preceded by a + or - sign.

This syntax is processed without consideration of what other
syntax follows.  A positive match may be directly followed by an unbound
variable.

.SS Regular Expressions

Like text, a regular expression (regexp) must match text in the data.  A regexp
which occurs at the beginning of a line matches the beginning of a line.  A
regexp which occurs elsewhere, other than following a variable, must match
exactly starting at the current position, where the previous match left off. A
regexp which occurs at the end of a line must match from the current position
to the end of the line.

The semantics of a regular expression which follow variables is
discussed in the preceding section Variables.

A regular expression, as a standalone directive, looks like this:

  @/RE/

where RE is regular expression syntax.
.B txr
contains an original implementation of regular expressions, which
supports the following syntax:
.IP .
matches any character.
.IP []
Character class: matches a single character, from the set specified by
the class. Supports basic regexp character class syntax; no POSIX
notation like [:digit:]. The class [a-zA-Z] means match an uppercase
or lowercase letter; the class [0-9a-f] means match a digit or
a lowercase letter, the class [^0-9] means match a non-digit, et cetera.
A ] or - can be used within a character class, but must be escaped
with a backslash. Two backslashes code for one backslash. So
for instance [\e[\e-] means match a [ or - character, [^^] means match
any character other than ^, and [\e^\e\e] means match either a ^ or a
backslash.
.IP (RE)
If RE is a regular expression, then so is (RE).
The contents of parentheses denote one regular expression unit, so that for
instance in (RE)*, the * operator applies to the entire parenthesized group.
.IP (RE)?
optionally matches the preceding regular expression (RE).
.IP (RE)+
matches the preceding expression one or more times.
.IP (RE)*
matches the preceding expression zero or more times.
.IP (RE1)(RE2)
Two consecutive regular expressions denote catenation:
the left expression must match, and then the right.

.IP (RE1)|(RE2)
matches either the expression RE1 or RE2.

.PP
Any of the special characters, including the delimiting /,  can be escaped with
a backslash to suppress its meaning and denote the character itself.

Furthermore, all of the same escapes are as described in the section Special
Characters in Text above---the difference is that in regular expressions, the @
character is not required, so for example a tab is coded as \et rather
than @\e\t.

Any escaped character which does not fall into the above escaping conventions,
or any unescaped character which is not a regular expression operator, denotes
one-position match of that character itself.

Character classes and parentheses have the highest precedence.

The postfix operators ?, + and * have the second highest precedence, and
associate left to right, so that in A+?*, the * applies to A+?, and the ?
applies to A+.

Catenation is on the next lower precedence rung, so that AB? means "match A,
and then optionally B" not "match A and B, as one optional unit".  The latter
must be written (AB)?  using parentheses to override precedence.

The disjunction operator | has the lowest precedence, lower than catenation.
Thus abc|def means "match abc, or match def". The meaning "match ab,
then c or d, then ef" must be expressed as ab(c|d)ef, or using
a character class: ab[cd]ef.

In
.b txr,
regular expression matches do not span multiple lines. There is no way
to match a newline character since it's simply not internally represented in
the data.

It's possible for a regular expression to match an empty string.
For instance, if the next input character is z, facing a
the regular expression /a?/, there is a zero-character match:
the regular expression's state machine can reach an acceptance
state without consuming any characters. Examples:

  pattern:      @A@/a?/@/.*/
  data:         zzzzz
  result:       A=""

  pattern:      @{A /a?/}@B
  data:         zzzzz
  result:       A="", B="zzzz"

  pattern:      @*A@/a?/
  data:         zzzzz
  result:       A="zzzzz"

In the first example, variable @A is followed by a regular expression
which can match an empty string. The expression faces the letter "z"
at position 0 in the data line. A zero-character match occurs there,
therefore the variable A takes on the empty string. The @/.*/ regular
expression then consumes the line.

Similarly, in the second example, the /a?/ regular expression faces
a "z", and thus yields an empty string which is bound to A. Variable
@B consumes the entire line.

The third example request the longest match for the variable binding.
Thus, a search takes place for the rightmost position where the
regular expression matches. The regular expression matches anywhere,
including the empty string after the last character, which is
the rightmost place. Thus variable A fetches the entire line.

.SS Directives

The general syntax of a directive is:

  @EXPR

where expr is a parenthesized list of subexpressions. A subexpression
is an symbol, number, string literal, character literal, quasiliteral, regular
expression, or a parenthesized expression.  So, examples of syntactically valid
directives are:

  @(banana)

  @(a b c (d e f))

  @(  a (b (c d) (e  ) ))

  @("apple" 'b' 3)

  @(a /[a-z]*/ b)

  @(_ `@file.txt`)

A symbol is lexically the same thing as a variable and the same rules
apply. Tokens that look like numbers are treated as numbers.

String and character literals are delimited by double and single quotes,
respectively, and may not span multiple lines. Character literals must contain
exactly one character. Character and numeric escapes may be used within
literals to escape the quotes, and to denote control characters.

Quasiliterals are similar to string literals, except that they may
contain variable references denoted by the usual @ syntax. The quasiliteral
represents a string formed by substituting the values of those variables
into the literal template. If a is bound to "apple" and b to "banana",
the quasiliteral `one@a and two @{b}s` represents the string
"one apple and two bananas". A backquote escaped by a backslash represents
itself, and two consecutive @ characters code for a literal @.
There is no \e@ escape.

Some directives are involved in structuring the overall syntax of the query.

There are syntactic constraints that depend on the directive.  For instance the
@(next) directive can take argument material, which is everything that follows
on the same line, until the end of the line.  But @(skip) does not take
argument material.  Most directives must be the first item of a line.

A summary of the available directives follows:

.IP @(next)
Continue matching in another file.

.IP @(block)
The remaining query is treated as an anonymous or named block.
Blocks may be referenced by @(accept) and @(fail) directives.
Blocks are discussed in the section BLOCKS below.

.IP @(skip)
Treat the remaining query as a subquery unit, and search the lines of
the input file until that subquery matches somewhere.
A skip is also an anonymous block.

.IP @(trailer)
Treat the remaining query or subquery as a match for a trailing context. That
is to say, if the remainder matches, the data position is not advanced.

.IP @(freeform)
Treat the remainder of the input as one big string, and apply the following
query line to that string. The newline characters (or custom separators) appear
explicitly in that string.

.IP @(some)
Match some clauses in parallel. At least one has to match.

.IP @(all)
Match some clauses in parallel. Each one must match.

.IP @(none)
Match some clauses in parallel. None must match.

.IP @(maybe)
Match some clauses in parallel, which may or may not match.
No failure occurs if none match.

.IP @(cases)
Match some clauses sequentially, stopping if one of them
matches successfully.

.IP @(define NAME ( ARGUMENTS ...))
Introduces a function. Functions are discussed in the FUNCTIONS section below.

.IP @(collect)
Search the data for multiple matches of a clause. Collect the
bindings in the clause into lists, which are output as array variables.
The @(collect) directive is line oriented. It works with a multi-line
pattern and scans line by line. A similar directive called @(coll)
works within one line.

A collect is an anonymous block.

.IP @(and)
Separator of clauses for @(some), @(all), and @(none).
Equivalent to @(or). Choice is stylistic.

.IP @(or)
Separator of clauses for @(some), @(all), and @(none).
Equivalent to @(and). Choice is stylistic.

.IP @(end)
Required terminator for @(some), @(all), @(none), @(maybe), @(cases),
@(collect), @(output), and @(repeat).

.IP @(fail)
Terminate the processing of a block, as if it were a failed match.
Blocks are discussed in the section BLOCKS below.

.IP @(accept)
Terminate the processing of a block, as if it were a successful match.
What bindings emerge may depend on the kind of block: collect
has special semantics.  Blocks are discussed in the section BLOCKS below.

.IP @(try)
Indicates the start of a try block, which is related to exception
handling, discussed in the EXCEPTIONS section below.

.IP @(catch), @(finally)
Special clauses within @(try). See EXCEPTIONS below.

.IP @(defex), @(throw)
Define custom exception types; throw an exception.  See EXCEPTIONS below.

.IP @(flatten)
Normalizes a set of specified variables to one-dimensional lists. Those
variables which have scalar value are reduced to lists of that value.
Those which are lists of lists (to an arbitrary level of nesting) are converted
to flat lists of their leaf values.

.IP @(merge)
Binds a new variable which is the result of merging two or more
other variables. Merging has somewhat complicated semantics.

.IP @(cat)
Decimates a list (any number of dimensions) to a string, by catenating its
constituent strings, with an optional separator string between all of the
values.

.IP @(bind)
Binds one or more variables against another variable using a structural
pattern. A limited form of unification takes place which can cause a match to
fail.

.IP @(output)
A directive which encloses an output clause in the query. An output section
does not match text, but produces text. The directives above are not
understood in an output clause.

.IP @(repeat)
A directive understood within an @(output) section, for repeating multi-line
text, with successive substitutions pulled from lists. A version @(rept)
produces repeated text within one line.

.PP

.SS The Next Directive

The next directive comes in two forms, one of which is obsolescent
syntax.  The directive indicates that the remainder of the query
is to be applied to a new input source.

In the first form, it can occur by itself as the only element in a query line,
with, or without arguments:

  @(next)
  @(next SOURCE)
  @(next SOURCE nothrow)
  @(next args)

The lone @(next) without arguments switches to the next file in the
argument list which was passed to the
.B txr
utility. If SOURCE is given, it must be text-valued expression which denotes an
input source; it may be a string literal, quasiliteral or a variable.
For instance, if variable A contains the text "data", then

  @(next A)

means switch to the file called "data", and

  @(next `@A.txt`)

means to switch to the file "data.txt".

If the input source cannot be opened for whatever reason,
.B txr
throws an exception (see EXCEPTIONS below). An unhandled exception will
terminate the program.  Often, such a drastic measure is inconvenient;
if @(next) is invoked with the nothrow keyword, then if the input
source cannot be opened, the situation is treated as a simple
match failure.

The variant @(next args) means that the remaining command line arguments are to
be treated as a data source. For this purpose, each argument is considered to
be a line of text. If an argument is currently being processed as an input
source, that argument is included. Note that if the first entry in the argument
list does not name an input source, then the query should begin with
@(next args) or some other form of next directive, to prevent an attempt to
open the input source named by that argument. If the very first directive of a query is any variant of the next directive, then
.B txr
avoids opening the first input source, but it does open the input source for
any other directive, even one which does not consume any data.

In the obsolescent second form, @(next) is followed by material on the same
line, which may contain variables.  All of the variables must be bound. For
example:

  @(next)/path/to/@foo.txt

The trailing material specifies gives the input source.
The nothrow behavior is implicit in this form. The syntax will
disappear in some future version of
.B txr
.


Note that "remainder of the query" refers to the subquery in which
the next directive appears, not necessarily the entire query.

For example, the following query looks for the line starting with "xyz"
at the top of the file "foo.txt", within a some directive.
After the @(end) which terminates the @(some), the "abc" is matched in the
current file.

  @(some)
  @(next "foo.txt")
  xyz@suffix
  @(end)
  abc

However, if the @(some) subquery successfully matched "xyz@suffix" within the
file foo.text,  there is now a binding for the suffix variable, which
is globally visible to the remainder of the entire query.

The @(next) directive supports the file name conventions as the command
line. The name - means standard input. Text which starts with a ! is
interpreted as a shell command whose output is read like a file.  These
interpretations are applied after variable substitution. If the file is
specified as @a, but the variable a expands to "!echo foo", then the output of
the "echo foo" command will be processed.

.SS The Skip Directive

The skip directive considers the remainder of the query as a search
pattern. The remainder is no longer required to strictly match at the
current line in the current file. Rather, the current file is searched,
starting with the current line, for the first line where the entire remainder
of the query will successfully match. If no such line is found, the skip
directive fails. If a matching position is found, the remainder of
the query is understood to be processed there.

Of course, the remainder of the query can itself contain skip directives.
Each such directive performs a recursive subsearch.

The skip directive has an optional numeric argument. The value of this
argument limits the range of lines scanned for a match. Judicious use
of this feature can improve the performance of queries.

Example: scan until "size: @SIZE" matches, which must happen within
the next 15 lines:

  @(skip 15)
  size: @SIZE

Without the range limitation skip will keep searching until it consumes
the entire input source. While sometimes this is what is intended,
often it is not. Sometimes a skip is nested within a collect, or
following another skip. For instance, consider:

  @(collect)
  begin @BEG_SYMBOL
  @(skip)
  end @BEG_SYMBOL
  @(end)

The collect iterates over the entire input. But, potentially, so does
the skip. Suppose that "begin x" is matched, but the data has no
matching "end x". The skip will search in vain all the way to the end of the
data, and then the collect will try another iteration back at the
beginning, just one line down from the original starting point.  If it is a
reasonable expectation that an "end x" occurs 15 lines of a "begin x", this can
be written instead:

  @(collect)
  begin @BEG_SYMBOL
  @(skip 15)
  end @BEG_SYMBOL
  @(end)

.SS The Trailer Directive

The trailer directive introduces a trailing portion of a query or subquery
which matches input material normally, but in the event of a successful match,
does not advance the current position. This can be used, for instance, to
cause @(collect) to match partially overlapping regions.

Example:

  @(collect)
  @line
  @(trailer)
  @(skip)
  @line
  @(end)

This script collects each line which has a duplicate somewhere later
in the input. Without the @(trailer) directive, this does not work properly
for inputs like:

  111
  222
  111
  222

Without @(trailer), the first duplicate pair constitutes a match which
spans over the 222. After that pair is found, the matching continues
after the second 111.

With the @(trailer) directive in place, the collect body, on each
iteration, only consumes the lines matched prior to @(trailer).

.SS The Freeform Directive

The freeform directive provides a useful alternative to
.B txr's
line-oriented matching discipline. The freeform directive treats all remaining
input from the current input source as one big line. The directive which
immediately follows freeform is applied to that line.

The syntax variations are:

  @(freeform)
  ... query line ..

  @(freeform NUMBER)
  ... query line ..

  @(freeform STRING)
  ... query line ..

  @(freeform NUMBER STRING)
  ... query line ..

The string and numeric arguments, if both are present, may be given in either
order.

If a numeric argument is given, it limits the range of lines which are combined
together. For instance @(freeform 5) means to only consider the next five lines
to to be one big line. Without a numeric argument, freeform is "bottomless". It
can match the entire file, which creates the risk of allocating a large amount
of memory.

If a string argument is given, it specifies a custom line terminator. The
default terminator is "\en". The terminator does not have to be one character
long.

In the following example, freeform is used to solve a tokenizing problem.  The
Unix password file has fields separated by colons. Some fields may be empty.
Using freeform, we can join the password file using ":" as a terminator.
By restricting freeform to one line, we can obtain each line of the password
file with a terminating ":", allowing for a simple tokenization, because
now the fields are colon-terminated rather than colon-separated.

Example:

  @(next "/etc/passwd")
  @(collect)
  @(freeform 1 ":")
  @(coll)@{token /[^:]*/}:@(end)
  @(end)

.SS The Some, All, None and Maybe directives

These directives combine multiple subqueries, which are applied at the same position in parallel. The syntax of all three follows this example:

  @(some)
  subquery1
  .
  .
  .
  @(and)
  subquery2
  .
  .
  .
  @(and)
  subquery3
  .
  .
  .
  @(end)

The @(some), @(all) or @(none) directive must appear as the only element in a
query line. It must be followed by at least one subquery clause, and terminated
by @(end). If there are two or more subqueries, these additional clauses are
indicated by @(and) or @(or), which are interchangeable.  The @(and), @(or) and
@(end) directives also must appear as the only element in a query line.

The syntax supports arbitrary nesting. For example:

  QUERY:            SYNTAX TREE:

  @(all)            all -+
  @  (skip)              +- skip -+
  @  (some)              |        +- some -+
  it                     |        |        +- TEXT
  @  (and)               |        |        +- and
  @    (none)            |        |        +- none -+
  was                    |        |        |        +- TEXT
  @    (end)             |        |        |        +- end
  @  (end)               |        |        +- end
  a dark                 |        +- TEXT
  @(end)                 *- end

nesting can be indicated using whitespace between @ and the
directive expression. Thus, the above is an @(all) query containing a @(skip)
clause which applies to a @(some) that is followed by the the text
line "a dark". The @(some) clause combines the text line "it",
and a @(none) clause which contains just one clause consisting of
the line "was".

The semantics of the some, all, none, maybe and cases directives is:

.IP @(all)
Each of the clauses is matched at the current position. If any of the
clauses fails to match, the directive fails (and thus does not produce
any variable bindings).

.IP @(some)
Each of the clauses is matched at the current position. If any
of the clauses succeed, the directive succeeds. The bindings from
all successful clauses are retained.

.IP @(none)
Each of the clauses is matched at the current position. The
directive succeeds only if all of the clauses fail. If
any clause succeeds, the directive fails. Thus, this
directive never produces variable bindings.

.IP @(maybe)
Each of the clauses is matched at the current position.
The directive succeeds even if all of the clauses fail.
Whatever bindings are found in any of the clauses are
retained.

.IP @(cases)
The clauses are matched, in order, at the current position.
If any clause matches, the matching stops and the bindings
collected from that clause are retained. Any remaining clauses
after that one are not processed. If no clause matches, the
directive fails, and produces no bindings.

When a @(some), @(all), or @(cases) directive matches successfully, or a
@(maybe) directive matches in at least one of its clauses, the query advances
by the greatest number of lines matched in any of the subclauses. For instance
if there are two subclauses, and one of them matches three lines, but the other
one matches five lines, then the overall clause is considered to have made a
five line match at its position. If more directives follow, they begin matching
five lines down from that position.

.SS The Collect Directive

The syntax of the collect directive is:

  @(collect)
  ... lines of subquery
  @(end)

or with an until clause:

  @(collect)
  ... lines of subquery: main clause
  @(until)
  ... lines of subquery: until clause
  @(end)


The subquery is matched repeatedly, starting at the current line.
If it fails to match, it is tried starting at the subsequent line.
If it matches successfully, it is tried at the line following the
entire extent of matched data, if there is one. Thus, the collected regions do
not overlap.

The collect as a whole always succeeds, even if the subquery does not match at
any position, and even if the until clause does not match. That is to say, a
query will never fail for the reason that a collect didn't collect anything.

If no until clause is specified, the collect is unbounded. It consumes the entire data file. If any query material follows such the collect clause, it will
fail if it tries to match anything in the current file; but of course, it
is possible to continue matching in another file by means of @(next).

If an until clause is specified, the collection stops when that clause matches
at the current position. When an until clause matches at a position,
no bindings are collected at that position, even if the main clause
matches at that position also. Moreover, the position is not advanced.
The remainder of the query begins matching at that position.

Example:

  Query:        @(collect)
                @a
                @(until)
                42
                @(end)

  Data:         1
                2
                3
                42
                5
                6

  Output:       a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"

The line 42 is not collected, even though it matches @a.

The binding variables within the clause of a collect are treated specially.
The multiple matches for each variable are collected into lists,
which then appear as array variables in the final output.

Example:

  Query:        @(collect)
                @a:@b:@c
                @(end)

  Data:         John:Doe:101
                Mary:Jane:202
                Bob:Coder:313

  Output:
                a[0]="John"
                a[1]="Mary"
                a[2]="Bob"
                b[0]="Doe"
                b[1]="Jane"
                b[2]="Coder"
                c[0]="101"
                c[1]="202"
                c[2]="313"

The query matches the data in three places, so each variable becomes
a list of three elements, reported as an array.

Variables with list bindings may be referenced in a query. They denote a
multiple match. The -D command line option can establish a one-dimensional
list binding.

Collect clauses may be nested.   Variable matches collated into lists in an
inner collect, are again collated into nested lists in the outer collect.
Thus an unbound variable wrapped in N nestings of @(collect) will
be an N-dimensional list. A one dimensional list is a list of strings;
a two dimensional list is a list of lists of strings, etc.

It is important to note that the variables which are bound within the main
clause of a collect---i.e. the variables which are subject to
collection---appear, within the collect, as normal one-value bindings. The
collation into lists happens outside of the collect. So for instance in the
query:

 @(collect)
 @x=@x
 @(end)

The left @x establishes a binding for some material preceding an equal sign.
The right @x refers to that binding. The value of @x is different in each
iteration, and these values are collected. What finally comes out of the
collect clause is list variable called x which holds each value that
was ever instantiated under that name within the collect clause.

Also note that the until clause has visibility over the bindings
established in the main clause. This is true even in the terminating
case when the until clause matches, and the bindings of the main clause
are discarded.

.SS The Coll Directive

The coll directive is a kind of miniature version of the collect directive.
Whereas the collect directive works with multi-line clauses on line-oriented
material, coll works within a single line. With coll, it is possible to
recognize repeating regularities within a line and collect lists.

Regular-expression based Positive Match variables work well with coll.

Example: collect a comma-separated list, terminated by a space.

  pattern:  @(coll)@{A /[^, ]+/}@(until) @(end)@B
  data:     foo,bar,xyzzy blorch
  result:   A[0]="foo"
            A[1]="bar"
            A[2]="xyzzy"
            B=blorch

Here, the variable A is bound to tokens which match the regular
expression /[^, ]+/: non-empty sequence of characters other than commas or
spaces.

Like its big cousin, the coll directive searches for matches.  If no match
occurs at the current character position, it tries at the next character
position. Whenever a match occurs, it continues at the character position which
follows the last character of the match, if such a position exists.

If not bounded by an until clause, it will exhaust the entire line.  If the
until clause matches, then the collection stops at that position,
and any bindings from that iteration are discarded.

Coll clauses nest, and variables bound within a coll are available to within
the rest of the coll clause, including the until clause, and appear as single
values.  The final list aggregation is only visible after the coll clause.

The behavior of coll is troublesome, when delimited variables are used,
because in text file formats, the material which separates items is not
repeated after the last item. For instance, a comma-separated list usually
not appear as "a,b,c," but rather "a,b,c". There might not be any explicit
termination---the last item might be at the very end of the line.

So for instance, the following result is not satisfactory:

  pattern:      @(coll)@a @(end)
  data:         1 2 3 4 5
  result:       a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"
                a[3]="4"

What happened to the 5? After matching "4 ", coll continues to look for
matches. It tries "5", which does not match, because it is not followed by a
space. Then the line is consumed.  So in this sequence, a valid item is either
followed by a space, or by nothing. So it is tempting to try this:

  pattern:      @(coll)@a@/ ?/@(end)
  data:         1 2 3 4 5
  result:       a[0]=""
                a[1]=""
                a[2]=""
                a[3]=""
                a[4]=""
                a[5]=""
                a[6]=""
                a[7]=""
                a[8]=""

however, the problem is that the regular expression / ?/ (match either a space
or nothing), matches at any position.  So when it is used as a variable
delimiter, it matches at the current position, which binds the empty string to
the variable, the extent of the match being zero. In this situation, the coll
directive proceeds character by character. The solution is to use
positive matching: specify the regular expression which matches the item,
rather than a trying to match whatever follows.  The collect directive will
recognize all items which match the regular expression.

  pattern:      @(coll)@{a /[^ ]+/}@(end)
  data:         1 2 3 4 5
  result:       a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"
                a[3]="4"
                a[4]="5"

The until clause can specify a pattern which, when recognized, terminates
the collection. So for instance, suppose that the list of items may
or may not be terminated by a semicolon. We must exclude
the semicolon from being a valid character inside an item, and
add an until clause which recognizes a semicolon:

  pattern:      @(coll)@{a /[^ ;]+/}@(until);@(end);

  data:         1 2 3 4 5;
  result:       a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"
                a[3]="4"
                a[4]="5"

  data:         1 2 3 4 5;
  result:       a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"
                a[3]="4"
                a[4]="5"

Semicolon or not, the items are collected properly.

Note that the @(end) is followed by a semicolon. That's because
when the @(until) clause meets a match, the matching material
is not consumed.

.SS The Flatten Directive.

The flatten directive can be used to convert variables to one dimensional
lists. Variables which have a scalar value are converted to lists containing
that value. Variables which are multidimensional lists are flattened to
one-dimensional lists.

Example (without @(flatten))

  pattern:      @b
                @(collect)
                @(collect)
                @a
                @(end)
                @(end)

  data:         0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5

  result:       b="0"
                a_0[0]="1"
                a_1[0]="2"
                a_2[0]="3"
                a_3[0]="4"
                a_4[0]="5"

Example (with flatten):

  pattern:      @b
                @(collect)
                @(collect)
                @a
                @(end)
                @(end)
                @(flatten a b)

  data:         0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5

  result:       b[0]="0"
                a[0]="1"
                a[1]="2"
                a[2]="3"
                a[3]="4"
                a[4]="5"


.SS The Cat Directive

The @(cat) directive converts a list variable into a single
piece of text. Optionally, a separating piece of text can be inserted
in between the elements. This piece is written to the right of
the @(cat) directive, and spans to the end of the line. It may
contain variable substitutions.

Example:

  pattern:      @(coll)@{a /[^ ]+/}@(end)
                @(cat a):
  data:         1 2 3 4 5
  result:       a="1:2:3:4:5"


.SS The Bind Directive

The @(bind) directive is a kind of pattern match, which matches one or more
variables on the left hand side to the value of a variable on the right hand
side.  The right hand side variable must have a binding, or else the directive
fails. Any variables on the left hand side which are unbound receive a matching
piece of the right hand side value. Any variables on the left which are already
bound must match their corresponding value, or the bind fails. Any variables
which are already bound and which do match their corresponding value remain
unchanged (the match can be inexact).

The simplest bind is of one variable against itself, for instance bind A
against A:

  @(bind A A)

This will fail if A is not bound, (and complain loudly). If A is bound, it
succeeds, since A matches A.

The next simplest bind binds one variable to another:

  @(bind A B)

Here, if A is unbound, it takes on the same value as B. If A is bound, it has
to match B, or the bind fails. Matching means that either

- A and B are the same text
- A is text, B is a list, and A occurs within B.
- vice versa: B is text, A is a list, and B occurs within A.
- A and B are lists and are either identical, or one is
  found as substructure within the other.

The right hand side does not have to be a variable. It may be some other
object, like a string, quasiliteral, regexp, or list of strings, et cetera. For
instance

  @(bind A "ab\tc")

will bind the string "ab\tc" (the letter a, b, a tab character, and c)
to the variable A if A is unbound. If A is bound, this will fail unless
A already contains an identical string.

The left hand side of a bind can be a nested list pattern containing variables.
The last item of a list at any nesting level can be preceded by a dot, which
means that the variable matches the rest of the list from that position.

Example: suppose that the list A contains ("now" "now" "brown" "cow"). Then the
directive @(bind (H N . C) A), assuming that H, N and C are unbound variables,
will bind H to "how", N to "now", and C to the remainder of the list ("brown"
"cow").

Example: suppose that the list A is nested to two dimensions and  contains
(("how" "now") ("brown" "cow")). Then @(bind ((H N) (B C)) A)
binds H to "how", N to "now", B to "brown" and C to "cow".

The dot notation may be used at any nesting level. it must be preceded and
followed by a symbol: the forms (.) (. X) and (X .) are invalid.

.SH BLOCKS

.SS Introduction

Blocks are sections of a query which are denoted by a name. Blocks denoted by
the name nil are understood as anonymous.

The @(block NAME) directive introduces a named block, except when the name is
the word nil.  The @(block) directive introduces an unnamed block, equivalent
to @(block nil).

The @(skip) and @(collect) directives introduce implicit anonymous blocks,
as do function bodies.

.SS Block Scope

The names of blocks are in a distinct namespace from the variable binding
space. So @(block foo) has no interaction with the variable @foo.

A block extends from the @(block ...) directive which introduces it,
to the end of the subquery in which that directive is contained. For instance:

  @(some)
  abc
  @(block foo)
  xyz
  @(end)

Here, the block foo occurs in a @(some) clause, and so it extends to the @(end)
which terminates that clause.  After that @(end), the name foo is not
associated with a block (is not "in scope"). A block which is not contained in
any subquery extends to the end of the overall query.  Blocks are never
terminated by @(end).

The implicit anonymous blocks introduced by @(skip) has the same scope
as the @(skip): it extends over all of the material which follows the skip, to the end of the containing subquery.

The scope of the implicit anonymous block introduced by @(collect) spans only
that collect coincides with the scope of that collect: from the @(collect)
to its matching @(end).

.SS Block Nesting

Blocks may nest, and nested blocks may have the same names as blocks in
which they are nested. For instance:

  @(block)
  @(block)
  ...

is a nesting of two anonymous blocks, and

  @(block foo)
  @(block foo)

is a nesting of two named blocks which happen to have the same name.
When a nested block has the same name as an outer block, it creates
a block scope in which the outer block is "shadowed"; that is to say,
directives which refer to that block name within the nested block refer to the
inner block, and not to the outer one.

A more complicated example of nesting is:

  @(skip)
  abc
  @(block)
  @(some)
  @(block foo)
  @(end)

Here, the @(skip) introduces an anonymous block. The explicit anonymous
@(block) is nested within skip's anonymous block and shadows it.
The foo block is nested within both of these.

.SS Block Semantics

A block normally does nothing. The query material in the block is evaluated
normally. However, a block serves as a termination point for @(fail) and
@(accept) directives which are in scope of that block and refer to it.

The precise meaning of these directives is:

.IP @(fail\ NAME)

Immediately terminate the enclosing query block called NAME, as if that block failed to match anything. If more than one block by that name encloses
the directive, the inner-most block is terminated. No bindings
emerge from a failed block.

.IP @(fail)

Immediately terminate the innermost enclosing anonymous block, as if
that block failed to match.

If the implicit block introduced by @(skip) is terminated in this manner,
this has the effect of causing the skip itself to fail. I.e. the behavior
is as if skip search did not find a match for the trailing material,
except that it takes place prematurely (before the end of the available
data source is reached).

If the implicit block associated with a @(collect)  is terminated this way,
then the entire collect fails. This is a special behavior, because a
collect normally does not fail, even if it matches and collects nothing!

To prematurely terminate a collect by means of its anonymous block, without
failing it, use @(accept).

.IP @(accept\ NAME)

Immediately terminate the enclosing query block called NAME, as if that block
successfully matched. If more than one block by that name encloses the
directive, the inner-most block is terminated.  Any bindings established within
that block until this point emerge from that block.

.IP @(accept)

Immediately terminate the innermost enclosing anonymous block, as if
that block successfully matched. Any bindings established within
that block until this point emerge from that block.

If the implicit block introduced by @(skip) is terminated in this manner,
this has the effect of causing the skip itself to succeed, as if
all of the trailing material successfully matched.

If the implicit block associated with a @(collect)  is terminated this way,
then the collection stops. All bindings collected in the current iteration of
the collect are discarded. Bindings collected in previous iterations are
retained, and collated into lists in accordance with the semantics of collect.

Example: alternative way to @(until) termination:

  @(collect)
  @  (maybe)
  ---
  @  (accept)
  @  (end)
  @LINE
  @(end)

This query will collect entire lines into a list called LINE. However,
if the line --- is matched (by the embedded @(maybe)), the collection
is terminated. Only the lines up to, and not including the --- line,
are collected. The effect is identical to:

  @(collect)
  @LINE
  @(until)
  ---
  @(end)

The difference (not relevant in these examples) is that the until clause has
visibility into the bindings set up by the main clause.

However, the following example has a different meaning:

  @(collect)
  @LINE
  @  (maybe)
  ---
  @  (accept)
  @  (end)
  @(end)

Now, lines are collected until the end of the data source, or until a line is
found which is followed by a --- line. If such a line is found,
the collection stops, and that line is not included in the collection!
The @(accept) terminates the process of the collect body, and so the
action of collecting the last @LINE binding into the list is not performed.

.SS Data Extent of Terminated Blocks

A query block may have matched some material prior to being terminated by
accept. In that case, it is deemed to have only matched that material,
and not any material which follows. This may matter, depending on the context
in which the block occurs.

Example:

  Query:        @(some)
                @(block foo)
                @first
                @(accept foo)
                @ignored
                @(end)
                @second

  Data:         1
                2
                3

  Output:       first="1"
                second="2"

At the point where the accept occurs, the foo block has matched the first line,
bound the text "1" to the variable @first. The block is then terminated.
Not only does the @first binding emerge from this terminated block, but
what also emerges is that the block advanced the data past the first line to
the second line. So next, the @(some) directive ends, and propagates the
bindings and position. Thus the @second which follows then matches the second
line and takes the text "2".

In the following query, the foo block occurs inside a maybe clause.
Inside the foo block there is a @(some) clause. Its first subclause
matches variable @first and then terminates block foo. Since block foo is
outside of the @(some) directive, this has the effect of terminating the
@(some) clause:

  Query:        @(maybe)
                @(block foo)
                @  (some)
                @first
                @  (accept foo)
                @  (or)
                @one
                @two
                @three
                @four
                @  (end)
                @(end)
                @second

  Data:         1
                2
                3
                4
                5

  Output:       first="1"
                second="2"

The second clause of the @(some) directive, namely:

  @one
  @two
  @three
  @four

is never processed. The reason is that subclauses are processed in top
to bottom order, but the processing was aborted within the
first clause the @(accept foo). The @(some) construct never had the
opportunity to match four lines.

If the @(accept foo) line is removed from the above query, the output
is different:

  Query:        @(maybe)
                @(block foo)
                @  (some)
                @first
                @#          <--  @(accept foo) removed from here!!!
                @  (or)
                @one
                @two
                @three
                @four
                @  (end)
                @(end)
                @second

  Data:         1
                2
                3
                4
                5

  Output:       first="1"
                one="1"
                two="2"
                three="3"
                four="4"
                second="5"

Now, all clauses of the @(some) directive have the opportunity to match.
The second clause grabs four lines, which is the longest match.
And so, the next line of input available for matching is 5, which goes
to the @second variable.

.SH FUNCTIONS

.SS Introduction

.B txr
functions allow a query to be structured to avoid repetition.
On a theoretical note, because
.B txr
functions support recursion, functions enable txr to match some
kinds of patterns which exhibit self-embedding, or nesting,
and thus cannot be matched by a regular language.

Functions in
.B txr
are not exactly like functions in mathematics or functional languages, and are
not like procedures in imperative programming languages. They are not exactly
like macros either. What it means for a
.B txr
function to take arguments and produce a result is different from
the conventional notion of a function.

A
.B txr
function may have one or more parameters. When such a function is invoked, an
argument must be specified for each parameter.  However, a special behavior is
at play here. Namely, some or all of the argument expressions may be unbound
variables.  In that case, the corresponding parameters behave like unbound
variables also.  Thus
.B txr
function calls can transmit the "unbound" state from argument to parameter.

It should be mentioned that functions have access to all bindings that are
visible in the caller; functions may refer to variables which are not
mentioned in their parameter list.

With regard to returning,
.B txr
functions are also unconventional. If the function fails, then the function
call is considered to have failed. The function call behaves like a kind of
match; if the function fails, then the call is like a failed match.

When a function call succeeds, then the bindings emanating from that function
are processed specially. Firstly, any bindings for variables which do not
correspond to one of the function's parameters are thrown away. Functions may
internally bind arbitrary variables in order to get their job done, but only
those variables which are named in the function argument list may propagate out
of the function call.  Thus, a function with no arguments can only indicate
matching success or failure, but not produce any bindings. Secondly,
variables do not propagate out of the function directly, but undergo
a renaming. For each parameter which went into the function as an unbound
variable (because its corresponding argument was an unbound variable),
if that parameter now has a value, that value is bound onto the corresponding
argument.

Example:

  @(define collect_words (list))
  @(coll)@{list /[^ \t]/}@(end)
  @(end)

The above function "collect_words" contains a query which collects words from a
line (sequences of characters other than space or tab), into the list variable
called "list".  This variable is named in the parameter list of the function,
therefore, its value, if it has one, is permitted to escape from the function
call.

Suppose the input data is:

  Fine summer day

and the function is called like this:

  @(collect_words wordlist)

The result is:

  wordlist[0]=Fine
  wordlist[1]=summer
  wordlist[1]=day

How it works is that in the function call @(collect_words wordlist),
"wordlist" is an unbound variable. The parameter corresponding to that
unbound variable is the parameter "list". Therefore, that parameter
is unbound over the body of the function.  The function body collects the
words of "Fine summer day" into the variable "list", and then
yields the that binding.   Then the function call completes by
noticing that the function parameter "list" now has a binding, and
that the corresponding argument "wordlist" has no binding. The binding
is thus transferred to the "wordlist" variable.  After that, the
bindings produced by the function are thrown away. The only enduring
effects are:

.IP -
the function matched and consumed some input; and

.IP -
the function succeeded; and

.IP -
the wordlist variable now has a binding.
.PP

Another way to understand the parameter behavior is that function
parameters behave like proxies which represent their arguments.  If an argument
is an established value, such as a character string or bound variable, the
parameter is a proxy for that value and behaves just like that value. If an
argument is an unbound variable, the function parameter acts as a proxy
representing that unbound variable. The effect of binding the proxy is
that the variable becomes bound, an effect which is settled when the
function goes out of scope.

Within the function, both the original variable and the proxy are
visible simultaneously, and are independent.  What if a function binds both of
them? Suppose a function has a parameter called P, which is called
with an argument A, and then in the function @A and @P are bound.  This is
permitted, and they can even be bound to different values.  However, when the
function terminates, the local binding of A simply disappears (because,
remember, the symbol A is not a member of the list of parameters).
Only the value bound to P emerges, and is bound to A, which still appears
unbound at that point.

.SS Definition Syntax

A function definition begins with a @(define ...) directive which must be the
only element in its line. The define must be followed by a symbol, which is the
name of the function being defined. After the symbol, there is a parenthesized
optional argument list. If there is no such list, or if the list is specified
as () or the symbol "nil" then the function has no parameters. Examples of
valid define syntax are:

  @(define foo)
  @(define bar ())
  @(define match (a b c))

The define directive may be followed directly by the @(end) directive,
also on a line by itself, in which case the function has an empty body.
Or it may be followed by one or more query lines and then @(end).
What is between a @(define ...) and its matching @(end) constitutes the
function body.

Functions may be nested within function bodies. Such local functions have
dynamic scope. They are visible in the function body in which they are defined,
and in any functions invoked from that body.

The body of a function is an anonymous block. (See BLOCKS above).

The following trivial function b produces no bindings and has a body which
simply matches the line "begin".

 @(define b)
 begin
 @(end)

Thus the call:

 @(b)

matches an input line "begin".

.SS Call Syntax

A function is invoked by compound directive whose first symbol is the name of
that function. Additional elements in the directive are the arguments.
Arguments may be symbols, or other objects like string and character
literals, quasiliterals ore regular expressions.

Example:

 Query:         @(define pair (a b))
                @a @b
                @(end)
                @(pair first second)
                @(pair "ice" cream)

 Data:          one two
                ice milk

 Output:        first="one"
                second="two"
                cream="milk"

The first call to the function takes the line "one two". The parameter "a"
takes "one" and parameter b takes "two". These are rebound to the arguments
first and second. The second call to the function binds the a parameter
to the word "ice", and the b is unbound, because the
corresponding argument "cream" is unbound. Thus inside the function, @a
is forced to match "ice". Then a space is matched and @b collects the text
"milk". When the function returns, the unbound "cream" variable gets this value.

If a symbol occurs multiple times in the argument list, it constrains
both parameters to bind to the same value. That is to say, all parameters
which, in the body of the function, bind a value, and which are all derived
from the same argument symbol must bind to the same value. This is settled when
the function terminates, not while it is matching. Example:

 Query:         @(define pair (a b))
                @a @b
                @(end)
                @(pair same same)

 Data:          one two

 Output:        [query fails, prints "false"]

.SS Nested Functions

Function definitions may appear in a function. Such definitions
are visible in all functions which are invoked from the body
(and not necessarily enclosed in the body). In other words, the
scope is dynamic, not lexical.  Inner definitions shadow outer
definitions. This means that a caller can redirect the function
calls that take place in a callee, by defining local functions
which capture the references.

Example:

  Query:        @(define which)
                @  (fun)
                @(end)
                @(define fun)
                @  (output)
                toplevel fun!
                @  (end)
                @(end)
                @(define callee)
                @  (define fun)
                @    (output)
                local fun!
                @    (end)
                @  (end)
                @  (which)
                @(end)
                @(callee)
                @(which)

   Output:      local fun!
                toplevel fun!

Here, the function "which" is defined which calls "fun".
A toplevel definition of "fun" is introduced which
outputs "toplevel fun!".  The function "callee" provides its own local
definition of "fun" which outputs "local fun!" before calling "which".  When
callee is invoked, it calls @(which), whose @(fun) call is routed to callee's
local definition.  When @(which) is called directly from the top level, its
@(fun) call goes to the toplevel definition.

.SH OUTPUT

.SS Introduction

A
.B txr
query may perform custom output. Output is performed by @(output) clauses,
which may be embedded anywhere in the query, or placed at the end.  Output
occurs as a side effect of producing a part of a query which contains an
@(output) directive, and is executed even if that part of the query ultimately
fails to find a match. Thus output can be useful for debugging.
An output clause specifies that its output goes to a file, pipe, or (by
default) standard output. If any output clause is executed whose destination is
standard output,
.B txr
makes a note of this, and later, just prior to termination, suppresses the
usual printing of the variable bindings or the word false.

.SS The Output Directive

The syntax of the @(output) directive is:

  @(output [ DESTINATION ] [ nothrow ])
  .
  . one or more output directives or lines
  .
  @(end)

An obsolescent syntax is also supported:

  @(output)...optional destination...
  .
  . one or more output directives or lines
  .
  @(end)

The optional destination is a filename, the special name, - which
redirects to standard output, or a shell command preceded by the ! symbol.
In the first form, the destination may be specified as a variable
which holds text, a string literal or a quasiliteral

In the second obsolescent form, the material to the right of @(output)
is query text which may contain variables.

The new syntax throws an exception if the output destination
cannot be opened, unless the nothrow keyword is present, in which
case the situation is treated as a match failure.  The old syntax throws an
exception.

.SS Output Text

Text in an output clause is not matched against anything, but is output
verbatim to the destination file, device or command pipe.

.SS Output Variables

Variables occurring in an output clause do not match anything, but instead their
contents are output. A variable being output must be a simple string, not a
list. Lists may be output within @(repeat) or @(rep) clauses. A list variable
must be wrapped in as many nestings of these clauses as it has dimensions.  For
instance, a two-dimensional list may be mentioned in output if it is inside a
@(rep) or @(repeat) clause which is itself wrapped inside another @(rep) or
@(repeat) clause.

In an output clause, the @{NAME NUMBER} variable syntax generates fixed-width
field, which contains the variable's text.  The absolute value of the
number specifies the field width. For instance -20 and 20 both specify a field
width of twenty.  If the text is longer than the field, then it overflows the
field. If the text is shorter than the field, then it is left-adjusted within
that field, if the width is specified as a positive number, and right-adjusted
if the width is specified as negative.

.SS The Repeat Directive

The repeat directive is generates repeated text from a ``boilerplate'',
by taking successive elements from lists. The syntax of repeat is
like this:

  @(repeat)
  .
  .
  main clause material, required
  .
  .
  special clauses, optional
  .
  .
  @(end)

Repeat has four types of special clauses, any of which may be
specified with empty contents, or omitted entirely. They are explained
below.

All of the material in the main clause and optional clauses
is examined for the presence of variables.  If none of the variables
hold lists which contain at least one item, then no output is performed,
(unless the repeat specifies an @(empty) clause, see below).
Otherwise, among those variables which contain non-empty lists, repeat finds
the length of the longest list. This length of this list determines the number
of repetitions, R.

If the repeat contains only a main clause, then the lines of this clause is
output R times. Over the first repetition, all of the variables which, outside
of the repeat, contain lists are locally rebound to just their first item. Over
the second repetition, all of the list variables are bound to their second
item, and so forth. Any variables which hold shorter lists than the longest
list eventually end up with empty values over some repetitions.

Example: if the list A holds "1", "2" and "3"; the list B holds "A", "B";
and the variable C holds "X", then

  @(repeat)
  >> @C
  >> @A @B
  @(end)

will produce three repetitions (since there are two lists, the longest
of which has three items). The output is:

  >> X
  >> 1 A
  >> X
  >> 2 B
  >> X
  >> 3

The last line has a trailing space, since it is produced by "@A @B",
where @B has an empty value. Since C is not a list variable, it
produces the same value in each repetition.

The special clauses are:

.IP @(single)
If the repeat produces exactly one repetition, then the contents of this clause
are processed for that one and only repetition, instead of the main clause
or any other clause which would otherwise be processed.

.IP @(first)
The body of this clause specifies an alternative body to be used for the first
repetition, instead of the material from the main clause.

.IP @(last)
The body of this clause is used instead of the main clause for the last
repetition.

.IP @(empty)
If the repeat produces no repetitions, then the body of this clause is output.
If this clause is absent or empty, the repeat produces no output.

.PP
The precedence among the clauses which take an iteration is:
single > first > last > main.   That is if two or more of these clauses
can apply to a repetition, then the leftmost one in this precedence list
applies. For instance, if there is just a single repetition, then any of these
special clause types can apply to that repetition, since it is the only
repetition, as well as the first and last one. In this situation, if
there is a single clause present, then the repetition is processed
using that clause. Otherwise, if there is a first clause present, that
clause is used. Failing that, a last clause applies. Only if none of these
clauses are present will the repetition be processed using the main clause.

.SS Nested Repeats

If a repeat clause encloses variables which holds multidimensional lists,
those lists require additional nesting levels of repeat (or rep).
It is an error to attempt to output a list variable which has not been
decimated into primary elements via a repeat construct.

Suppose that a variable X is two-dimensional (contains a list of lists).  X
must be twice nested in a repeat. The outer repeat will walk over the lists
contained in X. The inner repeat will walk over the elements of each of these
lists.

A nested repeat may be embedded in any of the clauses of a repeat,
not only the main clause.

.SS The Rep Directive

The @(rep) directive is similar to @(repeat), but whereas @(repeat) is line
oriented, @(rep) generates material within a line. It has all the same clauses,
but everything is specified within one line:

  @(rep)... main material ... .... special clauses ...@(end)

More than one @(rep) can occur within a line, mixed with other material.
A @(rep) can be nested within a @(repeat) or within another @(rep).

.SS Repeat and Rep Examples

Example 1: show the list L in parentheses, with spaces between
the elements, or the symbol NIL if the list is empty:

  @(output)
  @(rep)@L @(single)(@L)@(first)(@L @(last)@L)@(empty)NIL@(end)
  @(end)

Here, the @(empty) clause specifies NIL. So if there are no repetitions,
the text NIL is produced. If there is a single item in the list L,
then  @(single)(@L) produces that item between parentheses.  Otherwise
if there are two or more items, the first item is produced with
a leading parenthesis followed by a space by @(first)(@L , and
the last item is produced with a closing parenthesis: @(last)@L).
All items in between are emitted with a trailing space by
the main clause: @(rep)@L .

Example 2: show the list L like Example 1 above, but the empty list is ().

  @(output)
  (@(rep)@L @(last)@L@(end))
  @(end)

This is simpler. The parentheses are part of the text which
surrounds the @(rep) construct, produced unconditionally.
If the list L is empty, then @(rep) produces no output, resulting in ().
If the list L has one or more items, then they are produced with
spaces each one, except the last which has no space.
If the list has exactly one item, then the @(last) applies to it
instead of the main clause: it is produced with no trailing space.

.SH EXCEPTIONS

.SS Introduction

The exceptions mechanism in
.B txr
is another disciplined form of non-local transfer, in addition to the blocks
mechanism (see BLOCKS above).  Like blocks, exceptions provide a construct
which serves as the target for a dynamic exit.  Both blocks and exceptions
can be used to bail out of deep nesting when some condition occurs.
However, exceptions provide more complexity. Exceptions are useful for
error handling, and txr in fact maps certain error situations to exception
control transfers. However, exceptions are not inherently an error-handling
mechanism; they are a structured dynamic control transfer mechanism, one
of whose applications is error handling.

An exception control transfer (simply called an exception) is always identified
by a symbol, which is its type. Types are organized in a subtype-supertype
hierarchy.  For instance, the file_error exception type is a subtype of the
error type. This means that a file error is a kind of error. An exception
handling block which catches exceptions of type error will catch exceptions of
type file_error, but a block which catches file_error will not catch all
exceptions of type error. A query_error is a kind of error, but not a kind of
file_error. The symbol t is the supertype of every type: every exception type
is considered to be a kind of t.  (Mnemonic: t stands for type, as in any
type).

Exceptions are handled using @(catch) clauses within a @(try) directive.

In addition to being useful for exception handling, the @(try) directive
also provides unwind protection by means of a @(finally) clause,
which specifies query material to be executed unconditionally when
the try clause terminates, no matter how it terminates.

.SS The Try Directive

The general syntax of the try directive is

  @(try)
  ... main clause, required ...
  ... optional catch clauses ...
  ... optional finally clause
  @(end)

A catch clause looks like:

  @(catch TYPE)
  .
  .
  .

and also the this form, equivalent to @(catch (t)):

  @(catch)
  .
  .
  .

which catches all exceptions.

A finally clause looks like:

  @(finally)
  ...
  .
  .

The main clause may not be empty, but the catch and finally may be.

A try clause is surrounded by an implicit anonymous block (see BLOCKS section
above). So for instance, the following is a no-op (an operation with no effect,
other than successful execution):

  @(try)
  @(accept)
  @(end)

The @(accept) causes a successful termination of the implicit anonymous block.
Execution resumes with query lines or directives which follow, if any.

Try clauses and blocks interact. For instance, a block accept from within
a try clause invokes a finally.

  Query:        @(block foo)
                @  (try)
                @    (accept foo)
                @  (finally)
                @     (output)
                bye!
                @     (end)
                @  (end)

  Output:       bye!

How this works: the try block's main clause is @(accept foo). This causes
the enclosing block named foo to terminate, as a successful match.
Since the try is nested within this block, it too must terminate
in order for the block to terminate. But the try has a finally clause,
which executes unconditionally, no matter how the try block
terminates. The finally clause performs some output, which is seen.

.SS The Finally Clause

A try directive can terminate in one of three ways. The main clause
may match successfully, and possibly yield some new variable bindings.
The main clause may fail to match. Or the main clause may be terminated
by a non-local control transfer, like an exception being thrown or a block
return (like the block foo example in the previous section).

No matter how the try clause terminates, the finally clause is processed.

Now, the finally clause is itself a query which binds variables, which leads to
the question: what happens to such variables? What if the finally block fails
as a query? Another question is: what if a finally clause itself initiates a
control transfer?  Answers follow.

Firstly, a finally clause will contribute variable bindings only if the main
clause terminates normally (either as a successful or failed match).
If the main clause successfully matches, then the finally block continues
matching at the next position in the data, and contributes bindings.
If the main clause fails, then the finally block matches at the
same position.

The overall try directive succeeds as a match if either the main clause
or the finally clause succeed. If both fail, then the try directive is
a failed match. The subquery in which it is located fails, et cetera.

Example:

  Query:        @(try)
                @a
                @(finally)
                @b
                @(end)
                @c

  Data:         1
                2
                3

  Output:       a=1
                b=2
                c=3

In this example, the main clause of the try captures line "1" of the data as
variable a, then the finally clause captures "2" as b, and then the
query continues with the @c variable after try block, and captures "3".


Example:

  Query:        @(try)
                hello @a
                @(finally)
                @b
                @(end)
                @c

  Data:         1
                2

  Output:       b=1
                c=2

In this example, the main clause of the try fails to match, because
the input is not prefixed with "hello ". However, the finally clause
matches, binding b to "1". This means that the try block is a successful
match, and so processing continues with @c which captures "2".

When finally clauses are processed during a non-local return,
they have no externally visible effect if they do not bind variables.
However, their execution makes itself known if they perform side effects,
such as output.

A finally clause guards only the main clause and the catch clauses. It does not
guard itself.   Once the finally clause is executing, the try block is no
longer guarded.  This means if a nonlocal transfer, such as a block accept
or exception, is initiated within the finally clause, it will not re-execute
the finally clause. The finally clause is simply abandoned.

The disestablishment of blocks and try clauses is properly interleaved
with the execution of finally clauses. This means that all surrounding
exit points are visible in a finally clause, even if the finally clause
is being invoked as part of a transfer to a distant exit point.
The finally clause can make a control transfer to an exit point which
is more near than the original one, thereby "hijacking" the control
transfer. Also, the anonymous block established by the try directive
is visible in the finally clause.

Example:

@(try)
@  (try)
@    (next "nonexistent-file")
@  (finally)
@    (accept)
@  (end)
@(catch file_error)
@  (output)
file error caught
@  (end)
@(end)

In this example, the @(next) directive throws an exception of type file_error,
because the given file does not exist. The exit point for this exception is the
@(catch file_error) clause in the outer-most try block. The inner block is
not eligible because it contains no catch clauses at all. However, the inner
try block has a finally clause, and so during the processing of this
exception which is headed for the @(catch file_error), the finally
clause performs an anonymous accept. The exit point for the accept
is the anonymous block surrounding the inner try.  So the original
transfer to the catch clause is forgotten. The inner try terminates
successfully, and since it constitutes the main clause of the outer try,
that also terminates successfully. The "file error caught" message is
never printed.

.SS Catch Clauses

Catch clauses establish a try block as a potential exit point for
an exception-induced control transfer (called a ``throw'').

A catch clause specifies an optional list of symbols which represent
the exception types which it catches. The catch clause will catch
exceptions which are a subtype of any one of those exception types.

If a try block has more than one catch clause which can match a given
exception, the first one will be invoked.

The exception protection of a try block does not extend over the
catch clauses.  Once a catch clause is being executed, if it throws
an exception, that exception will not re-enter any catch within the
same try block, even if it matches one.

Catches are processed prior to finally.

When a catch is invoked, it is of course understood that the main clause did
not terminate normally, and so the main clause could not have produced any
bindings.

So the success or failure of the try block depends on the behavior of the catch
clause or the finally, if there is one. If either of them succeed, then the try block is considered a successful match.

Example:

  Query:        @(try)
                @  (next "nonexistent-file")
                @  x
                @  (catch file_error)
                @a
                @(finally)
                @b
                @(end)
                @c

  Data:         1
                2
                3

  Output:       a=1
                b=2
                c=3

Here, the try block's main clause is terminated abruptly by a file_error
exception from the @(next) directive.   This is handled by the
catch clause, which binds variable a to the input line "1".
Then the finally clause executes, binding b to "2". The try block
then terminates successfully, and so @c takes "3".

.SS Catch Clauses with Parameters

A catch may have parameters following the type name, like this:

  @(catch pair (a b))

To write a catch-all with parameters, explicitly write the
master supertype t:

  @(catch t (arg ...))

Parameters are useful in conjunction with throw. The built-in
error exceptions generate one argument, which is a string containing
the error message. Using throw, arbitrary parameters can be passed
from the throw site to the catches.

.SS The Throw Directive

The throw directive generates an exception. A type must be specified,
followed by optional arguments. For example,

  @(throw pair "a" `@file.txt`)

throws an exception of type pair, with two arguments, being "a"
and the expansion of the quasiliteral `@file.txt`.

The selection of the target catch is performed purely using the type
name; the parameters are not involved in the selection.

Binding takes place between the arguments given in throw, and the
target catch.

If any catch parameter, for which a throw argument is given, is a bound
variable, it has to be identical to the argument, otherwise the catch fails.
(Control still passes to the catch, but the catch is a failed match).

  Query:        @(bind a "apple")
                @(try)
                @(throw e "banana")
                @(catch e (a))
                @(end)

  Output:       false

If any argument is an unbound variable, the corresponding parameter
in the catch is left alone: if it is an unbound variable, it remains
unbound, and if it is bound, it stays as is.

  Query:        @(try)
                @(trow e "honda" unbound)
                @(catch e (car1 car2))
                @car1 @car2
                @(end)

  Data:         honda toyota

  Output:       car1="honda"
                car2="toyota"

If a catch has fewer parameters than there are throw arguments,
the excess arguments are ignored.

  Query:         @(try)
                 @(throw e "banana" "apple" "pear")
                 @(catch e (fruit))
                 @(end)

  Output:        fruit="banana"

If a catch has more parameters than there are throw arguments, the excess
parameters are left alone. They may be bound or unbound variables.

  Query:        @(try)
                @(trow e "honda")
                @(catch e (car1 car2))
                @car1 @car2
                @(end)

  Data:         honda toyota

  Output:       car1="honda"
                car2="toyota"

A throw argument passing a value to a catch parameter which is unbound causes
that parameter to be bound to that value.

Throw arguments are evaluated in the context of the throw, and the bindings
which are available there. Consideration of what parameters are bound
is done in the context of the catch.

  Query:        @(bind c "c")
                @(try)
                @(forget c)
                @(bind (a c) ("a" "lc"))
                @(throw e a c)
                @(catch e (b a))
                @(end)

   Output:      c="c"
                b="a"
                a="lc"

In the above example, c has a toplevel binding to the string "c",
but is then unbound within the try construct, and rebound to the value "c".
Since the try construct is terminated by a throw, these modifications of the
binding environment are discarded. Hence, at the end of the query, variable
c ends up bound to the original value "c".  The throw still takes place
within the scope of the bindings set up by the try clause, so the values of
a and c that are thrown are "a" and "lc".  However, at the catch site, variable
a does not have a binding.  At that point, the binding to "a" established in
the try has disappeared already. Being unbound, the catch parameter a can take
whatever value the corresponding throw argument provides, so it ends up with
"lc".

.SS The Defex Directive

The defex directive allows the query writer to invent custom exception types,
which are arranged in a type hierarchy (meaning that some exception types are
considered subtypes of other types).

Subtyping means that if an exception type B is a subtype of A, then every
exception of type B is also considered to be of type A. So a catch for type A
will also catch exceptions of type B.  Every type is a supertype of itself: an
A is a kind of A. This of course implies that ever type is a subtype of itself
also.  Furthermore, every type is a subtype of the type t, which has no
supertype other than itself. Type nil is is a subtype of every type, including
itself.  The subtyping relationship is transitive also. If A is a subtype
of B, and B is a subtype of C, then A is a subtype of C.

Defex may be invoked with no arguments, in which case it does nothing:

  @(defex)

It may be invoked with one argument, which must be a symbol. This introduces a
new exception type. Strictly speaking, such an introduction is not necessary;
any symbol may be used as an exception type without being introduced by
@(defex):

  @(defex a)

Therefore, this also does nothing, other than document the intent to use
a as an exception.

If two or more argument symbols are given, the symbols are all introduced as
types, engaged in a subtype-supertype relationship from left to right.
That is to say, the first (leftmost) symbol is a subtype of the next one,
which is a subtype of the next one and so on. The last symbol, if it
had not been already defined as a subtype of some type, becomes a
direct subtype of the master supertype t. Example:

  @(defex d e)
  @(defex a b c d)

The fist directive defines d as a subtype of e, and e as a subtype of t.
The second defines a as a subtype of b, b as a subtype of c, and
c as a subtype of d, which is already defined as a subtype of e.
Thus a is now a subtype of e. It should be obvious that the above
could be condensed to:

  @(defex a b c d e)

Example:

  Query:        @(defex gorilla ape primate)
                @(defex monkey primate)
                @(defex human primate)
                @(collect)
                @(try)
                @(skip)
                @(cases)
                gorilla @name
                @(throw gorilla name)
                @(or)
                monkey @name
                @(throw monkey name)
                @(or)
                human @name
                @(throw human name)
                @(end)@#cases
                @(catch primate (name))
                @kind @name
                @(output)
                we have a primate @name of kind @kind
                @(end)@#output
                @(end)@#try
                @(end)@#collect


  Input:        gorilla joe
                human bob
                monkey alice

  Output:       we have a primate joe of kind gorilla
                we have a primate bob of kind human
                we have a primate alice of kind monkey

Exception types have a pervasive scope. Once a type relationship is introduced,
it is visible everywhere. Moreover, the defex directive is destructive,
meaning that the supertype of a type can be redefined. This is necessary so
that something like the following works right.

  @(defex gorilla ape)
  @(defex ape primate)

These directives are evaluated in sequence. So after the first one, the ape
type has the type t as its immediate supertype.  But in the second directive,
ape appears again, and is assigned the primate supertype, while retaining
gorilla as a subtype.  This situation could instead be diagnosed as an
error, forcing the programmer to reorder the statements, but instead
txr obliges. However, there are limitations.  It is an error to define a
subtype-supertype relationship between two types if they are already connected
by such a relationship, directly or transitively. So the following
definitions are in error:

  @(defex a b)
  @(defex b c)
  @(defex a c)@# error: a is already a subtype of c, through b

  @(defex x y)
  @(defex y x)@# error: circularity; y is already a supertype of x.

.SH NOTES ON FALSE

The reason for printing the word
.IR false
on standard output when
a query doesn't match, in addition to returning a failed termination
status, is that the output of
.B txr
may be collected by a shell script, by the application of eval to command
substitution syntax. Printing
.IR false
will cause eval to evaluate the
.IR false
command, and thus failed status will propagate from the eval
itself.   The eval command conceals the termination status of a
program run via command substitution.  That is to say, if a program
fails, without producing output, its output is substituted into the eval
command which then succeeds, masking the failure of the program. For example:

  eval "$(false)"

appears successful: the false utility indicates a failed status, but
produces no output. Eval evaluates an empty script and reports success;
the failed status of the false program is forgotten.
Note the difference between the above and this:

  eval "$(echo false)"

This command has a failed status. The echo prints the word false and succeeds;
this false word is then evaluated as a script, and thus interpreted as the
false command which fails. This failure
.B is
propagated as the result of the eval
command.
