2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (reg_op): New static function.
	(eval_init): Register operators with reg_op instead of direct sethash
	calls.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (make_like): If the first element of list isn't
	a character, then don't try to make it into a string;
	keep it as a list. This allows [mapcar list "abc" "def"]
	to work intuitively rather than blow up.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (lit_s): New symbol.
	(code2type): Return lit_s for LIT type.
	(typeof): Return lit_s for TAG_LIT.
	(replace_str): Error message wording.
	(obj_init): lit_s interned.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (do_eval): Set last_form_evaled just before
	dispatching function, so it is not clobbered by argument evaluations.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_op): Use rlcp_tree when constructing the
	dwim_body, since the append2 copies list structure.

	* parser.y (n_exprs): propagate source loc info from both 
	constituents, giving precedence to the left one, rather than just taking
	it from the left one and ignoring the second constituent.  This fixes
	cases of missing location info. The left constituent n_expr is often 
	a symbol, and those do not have location info. We want a case like
	like ((x) y) to take from (x), and (x (y)) to take it from (y),
	and so on.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (list): For @n_expr, get the source location info
	from the @ token.
	(n_expr): Bugfix: do not attribute a symbol with location info.
	(quasilit): Obtain location info from quasi_items, and only
	if that is unavailable, then from lineno.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 81

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES, txr.vim: Updated.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l (regex_parse, lisp_parse): Better formatting
	for the context string that serves in place of a filename.

2014-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_place): Unnecessary, buggy function removed.
	It was handling silly special cases with the net effect of being
	nearly equivalent to just expand, while failing to expand places
	which are compound macro calls. It did diagnose nonexistent place
	types at expansion time, which isn't worth much.
	(expand): All the expansions for the mutating operator sset, inc, dec,
	push, pop and flip were also pointless and have been removed.  they did
	the precise equivalent of doing expand(rest(form)), and consing the
	symbol to the front, which is the fallback case for function call
	forms.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Make it an error to have implicit function declarations by
	means of -Werror=implicit-function-declarations.  Fix broken mkdir and
	mknod tests. Regenerate config.make if we add -U__STRICT_ANSI__
	to the compiler options, so that later tests benefit from this.
	Regenerate config.make right away if adding -D_DARWIN_C_SOURCE.
	This allows the makedev test to pass.

	* stream.c: Include <sys/types.h> for makedev.
	(mknod_wrap): Don't rely on makedev wrappers to be there; test.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (spec): Bugfix: SECRET_ESCAPE_E should use n_expr
	not expr. expr is subject to expand_meta.
	(n_expr): Do not associate source info with character
	literals.
	(expand_meta): Bugfix: when walking forms in a collecting loop,
	propagate the source info to them. Bugfix: attach source
	info to var and expr expansions.
	(rl): Rewritten in terms of rlset.
	(rlset): Only set source info for an object that doesn't already
	have it.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_init): Revert qquote, unquote and splice
	to the system namespace, for hygiene.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): HAVE_MAKEDEV not HAVE_MKDEV.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (getcwd_wrap): Implement correct test of getcwd's
	return value.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Use -Werror= on the missing prototypes and
	strict prototypes warnings; these should be errors.

2014-02-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Added feature tests for makedev, link/symlink/readlink,
	mkdir and mknod.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Wrap #ifdefs around the registrations of
	the wrappers for these functions.

	* stream.c (mkdir_wrap): Wrap in #ifdef HAVE_MKDIR, and
	provide a Windows version if HAVE_MKDIR is missing, but
	HAVE_WINDOWS_H is true.
	(makedev_wrap, major_wrap, minor_wrap): Wrap with #if HAVE_MAKEDEV.
	(mknod): Use #if HAVE_MKNOD.
	(symlink_wrap, link_wrap, readlink_wrap): Wrap with #if HAVE_SYMLINK.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (debug): Fix 2013-12-02 regression, which leaves the
	debugger not printing the current line of data.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Intern symlink_wrap, link_wrap, readlink_wrap.

	* stream.c (symlink_wrap, link_wrap, readlink_wrap): New functions.

	* stream.h (symlink_wrap, link_wrap, readlink_wrap): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register forgotten s_ifsock variable.
	Register mkdir_wrap, chdir_wrap, getcwd_wrap, makedev_wrap, minor_wrap,
	major_wrap and mknod_wrap.

	* stream.c (mkdir_wrap, chdir_wrap, getcwd_wrap, makedev_wrap,
	minor_wrap, major_wrap, mknod_wrap): New functions.
	(stream_init): Initialize forgotten variable s-ifsock.

	* stream.h (s_ifsock): Declared.
	(mkdir_wrap, chdir_wrap, getcwd_wrap, makedev_wrap,
	minor_wrap, major_wrap, mknod_wrap): Declared.

	* txr.1: Forgotten documentation for remove-path and rename-path
	added. Forgotten mention of s-ifsock. Documented new Unix functions.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Support octal and binary numbers.

	* txr.1: Documented.

	* genvim.txr, txr.vim: Updated.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (modifiers): Bugfix: list element not subject to expansion
	of Lisp forms denoted by @.
	(expand_meta): Bugfix: failure to expand vars, which can be
	symbol macros now.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Render quasi-quote hash and
	vector literals using their original notation.

	* parser.y (unquotes_occur): Takes new argument, level. 
	Only finds quotes which are at the given quasiquoting level.
	Finally, this is the right semantics. In the first version of this
	function, we were not eager enough: we neglected to find unquotes
	that were wrapped in nested quasiquotes. Then we were too eager:
	finding any unquotes, even ones belonging to the inner backquotes.
	(vector, hash, choose_quote): Pass zero to unquotes_occur function.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_qquote): Bugfix. Was not handling an unquote
	in the dotted position: (qquote x1 .. xn . (unquote form)),
	which looks like the structure (qquote x1 .. xn unquote form).
	Fixed by a hack: after recursively expanding the (unquote form)
	part (rest of the form), we check whether the unexpanded
	version has unquote at the front. If so, we know the expansion is just
	form, and use it to emit the suitable expansion.

2014-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Symbol macros.

	* eval.c (top_smb, defsymacro_s, symacrolet_s): New global variables.
	(lookup_symac, get_opt_param_syms, get_param_syms, op_defsymacro,
	expand_symacrolet, make_var_shadowing_env): New static functions.
	(expand_tree_cases, expand_catch_clause): Install shadowing environment
	so lexical bindings hide any symbol macrolets.
	(expand_place): Fix neglect to expand an atomic form, which breaks
	symbol macros used as places.
	(expand): Expand symbol macros, expand symacrolet binding forms.
	Make sure symbol macros are shadowed in the lexical binding
	constructs. Take advantage of return value of rlcp_tree in a
	few places.
	(macro_form_p): Support for symbol macros; bugfix: not handling
	default argument.
	(macroexpand_1): Streamlined, and support added for symbol macros.
	(eval_init): Protect top_smb from gc. Create new hash, stored in
	top_smb. Initialize defsymacro_s and symacrolet_s.
	Register op_defsymacro.

	* parser.y (rlcp_tree): Return the to form instead of useless t and nil.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Document quasiquote operator syntax.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (env_fbind, env_vbind): Use acons_new_c, and provide
	a much more useful return value: the binding cell itself,
	rather than the symbol.
	(bind_args): Bugfix: env_vbind was still being called in one case,
	leading to a neglect to bind a special variable properly.
	(bindings_helper): Changed interface. Bugfix: in sequential binding,
	actually bind the successive environments so closures will behave
	100% correctly. Returns a list of the actual bindings, in which
	special variables are not distinguished in any way.
	(op_let, op_for): Conform to new bindings_helper interface. Use the
	lexical environment that it returns instead of making a new one.
	(op_each): Use the environment and list of bindings out of
	bindings_helper. The bindings are used for stepping the lists,
	and that includes stepping any special vars. The lexical environment
	is used for evaluating the body. Thus, we need no special processing
	for special vars here any more.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bindings_helper): This must now bind dynamic values
	rather than just assign to them. Got rid of the superfluous variable
	saving array. Fixed the problem in recognizing the special_s symbol (it
	is bindable).
	(op_with_saved_vars): This simplifies, since it no longer needs
	to save individual variables in an array, only to set up and
	tear down a new dynamic environment frame.
	(expand_vars): No longer returns two values with a cons. 
	Takes a form argument for error reporting and a pointer to a boolean
	just to report whether there are special vars without listing them.
	(expand_save_specials): The with-saved-specials form doesn't need
	a var list any more, so the expander is updated not to stick them in.
	(expand): Update calls to expand_vars to new interface.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (get_string_from_stream): Bugfix: do not abort if
	stream is not a string stream, but throw a proper error exception.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Get special variable overriding working in function and macro
	parameter lists.

	There is a bugfix here too (see eval_init below).

	* eval.c (special_s): New global variable. This symbol is used
	as a marker in parameter lists denoting expander-generating
	syntax that gives information about specials.
	(lookup_var, looup_var_l): Bugfix: walk the dynamic chain properly.
	Fallback from the lexical chain to the dynamic.
	(env_vbind_special): New static function.
	(bind_args, bind_macro_params):  Detect special list in params. Use
	env_vbind_special to bind variables either in the dynamic environment
	or the lexical one.
	(expand_opt_params, expand_params): Renamed to expand_opt_params_rec
	and expand_params_rec, respectively. Now take extra argument for
	accumulating list of special variables found in the param list.
	(expand_params): New static function.
	(set_dyn_env): New static function.
	(interp_fun, expand_macro): Set up and tear down new dynamic
	environment around parameter list evaluation and body evaluation. This
	will take any new dynamic bindings.
	(bindings_helper, op_each): The special_s symbol is now used instead of
	colon_k for marking specials.
	(op_defun): Recognize the specials added to the parameter list
	so as not to t report that as not a bindable symbol.
	(op_catch): Set up an tear down new dynamic environment around
	the evaluation of the catch clause param binding and body.
	(expand_vars): use colon_s symbol instead of colon_k for marking
	special var.
	(eval_init): Bugfix: gc-protect recently added dyn_env variable.
	Intern special symbol into special_s variable.

2014-02-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Introducing some changes for improved handling of special variables.
	Saving and restoring of individual variables is very silly
	and it's making it difficult to implement function parameters
	that are rebindings of special variables.

	Let's have a global pointer to a dynamic environment called dyn_env.
	Let's make it part of the extended_jmp_buf structure, so that it's
	implicitly saved and restored across exception handling.

	Special variable lookups go through the dyn_env chain, and fall back on
	the global bindings.

	To override some specials, we just push a new dynamic environment and
	stick them there. (As a bonus, the bindings can even be repeated in the
	lexical environment (i.e. the same objects), so they can be found
	faster. We have to make sure we remove that environment when we
	leave the scope in the normal way. If we unwind out, it is done
	automatically by extended_longjmp mechanism.

	* eval.c (dyn_env): New global variable.
	(lookup_var, lookup_var_l): If env is nil, look in the dyn_env
	first, and only if that fails, look in the global bindings top_vb.

	* signal.h (extended_jmp_buf): New member, de, for saving/restoring
	dyn_env. This structure is now used whether or not we have signals.
	(extended_setjmp, extended_longjmp): Updated to save and restore
	dyn_env, and to do it regardless of whether there is POSIX signal
	support.
	(dyn_env): Declared here.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (symbol_function): Retrieve the global macro binding if the
	function lookup fails, and if that fails, retrieve the special
	operator binding.
	(fboundp): Report t if there is a global macro binding.

	* txr.1: Use "global" rather than "toplevel". Added note that
	the fun operator doesn't see macro bindings. Documented that
	symbol-function and fboundp see global macro bindings,
	and that symbol-function can retrieve a special operator binding.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (prinl, pprinl): New functions.
	(eval_init): Registered as intrinsics.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_init): changing the quote, qquote, unquote
	and splice symbols to be in the regular user package,
	rather than the system package.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y: Allow the (. expr) syntax to denote expr.

	* eval.h: Declare existing lambda_s extern variable.

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): print (lambda sym ...)
	as (lambda (. sym) ...) and (lambda sym) as (lambda (. sym)).

	* txr.1: document it.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implemented macrolet.

	* eval.c (macrolet_s): New variable.
	(lookup_mac, expand_macrolet): New static functions.
	(expand): Recognize and expand macrolet form.
	use lookup_mac to resolve macros rather than gethash,
	since we have lexical macros now.
	(eval_init): Intern macrolet symbol.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_macro_params, expand_macro, macroexpand_1, macroexpand):
	Rename mac_env variable to menv for consistency.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Preparation for lexical macros: we need to pass a macro
	environment down through the expander call hierarchy.

	* eval.c (expand_opt_params, expand_params, expand_tree_cases,
	expand_tree_case, expand_forms, val expand_cond_pairs, val
	expand_place, expand_qquote, expand_vars, expand_quasi, expand_op,
	expand_catch_clause, expand_catch, expand): All expanders get new
	parameter, menv. expand_forms and expand handle a nil value of menv.
	(eval_intrinsic): Pass nil macro environment to expand.
	(eval_init): Update intrinsic registration for expand.

	* eval.h (expand, expand_forms): Declarations updated.

	* parser.y (expand_meta): Gets macro env parameter.
	(elem, o_elem, exprs, expr): Pass nil to expand_forms and expand_meta.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Replacing uses of the eq function which are used only as C booleans,
	with just using the == operator. 

	Removing cobj_equal_op since it's indistinguishable from eq.

	Streamlining missingp and null_or_missing_p.

	* eval.c (transform_op): eq to ==.
	(c_var_ops): cobj_equal_op to eq.

	* filter.c (trie_compress, trie_lookup_feed_char, filter_string_tree,
	html_hex_continue, html_dec_continue): eq to ==.

	* hash.c (hash_iter_ops): cobj_equal to eq.

	* lib.c (countq, getplist, getplist_f, search_str_tree,
	posq): eq to ==.
	(cobj_equal_op): Function removed.

	* lib.h (cobj_equal_op): Declaration removed.
	(missingp): Becomes a simple macro that yields a C boolean instead
	of t/nil val, because it's only used that way.
	(null_or_missing_p): Becomes inline function returning int.

	* match.c (v_output): eq to ==.

	* rand.c (random_state_ops): cobj_equal_op to eq.

	* regex.c (char_set_obj_ops, regex_obj_ops): cobj_equal_op to eq.
	(reg_derivative): Silly if3 expression replaced by null.
	(regexp): Redundant if2 expression wrapped around eq removed.

	* stream.c (null_ops, stdio_ops, tail_ops, pipe_ops, string_in_ops,
	byte_in_ops, string_out_ops, strlist_out_ops, dir_ops,
	cat_stream_ops): cobj_equal_op to eq.

	* syslog.c (syslog_strm_ops): cobj_equal_op to eq.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	The C function nullp is being renamed to null, and the rarely
	used global variable null which holds a symbol becomes null_s.

	A new macro called nilp is added that more efficiently checks whether
	an object is nil, producing a C boolean value rather than t or nil.

	Most of the uses of nullp in the codebase just become the more
	streamlined nilp.

	* debug.c (show_bindings): nullp to nilp

	* eval.c (lookup_var, lookup_var_l, lookup_fun, lookup_sym_lisp1,
	do_eval, expand_qquote, expand_quasi, expand_op): nullp to nilp.
	(op_modplace): nullp to null.
	(eval_init): Update registration of null and not from C function
	nullp to null.

	* filter.c (trie_compress, html_hex_continue): nullp to nil.
	(filter_string_tree): null to null_s.

	* hash.c (hash_next): nullp to nilp.

	* lib.c (null): Variable renamed to null_s.
	(code2type): null to null_s.
	(lazy_flatten_scan, chainv, lazy_str, lazy_str_force_upto,
	obj_print, obj_pprint):
	nullp to nilp.
	(obj_init): null to null_s; nullp to null.

	* lib.h (null): declaration changed to null_s.
	(nullp): Inline function renamed to null.
	(nilp): New macro.

	* match.c (do_match_line): nullp to nilp.

	* rand.c (make_random_state): Likewise.

	* regex.c (compile_regex): Likewise.

2014-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y: Bugfix, I think. :) We do not need to call the expander
	for a Lisp expression in a quasistring, and doing so leads to a
	potentially incorrect double expansion because the whole thing
	will be expanded again, either by the TXR Lisp quasi operator's
	expander (if this is a quasiliteral in Lisp) or in the TXR
	pattern language, by expand_meta, which hunts down down @ expressions
	and expands them. 

2014-02-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implementing special variables with local overriding.
	All predefined globals become special.

	* eval.c (special, with_saved_vars_s): New global variables.
	(mark_special, special_p): New functions.
	(bindings_helper): Takes new argument, include_specials.
	Now processes the special colon syntax for denoting special variables,
	setting up their values, taking care to observe whether the
	binding is parallel or sequential.
	(op_let, op_for): Pass new argument to bindings_helper.
	(op_each): Pass new argument to bindings_helper with a value of it,
	and deal with the colon annotations that emerge in the bindings.
	(op_defvar, regvar): Mark symbol as special.
	(op_with_saved_vars): New static function.
	(expand_vars): Takes new argument, returns a cons. Detects special
	variables among the vars and produces the colon syntax.
	(expand_catch_clause): Bugfix: this was using expand_vars on
	a parameter list. Now properly uses expand_params.
	(expand_save_specials): New static function.
	(expand): For the operators that are binding constructs, handle
	the new form of expand_vars which returns information about
	special variables. If specials occur, then generate the 
	with-saved-vars form around the expansion which will save and restore
	their values. The expansion of vars done by expand_vars, together
	with the run-time actions of bindings_helper, do the rest.
	Speaking of which, the new with-saved-vars operator form is now
	expanded here too.
	(eval_init): Protect new variables special and with_saved_vars_s.
	Initialize special with new hash table. Store new interned
	symbol in with_saved_vars_s. Register op_with_save_vars in op_table.

	* txr.1: Documented specials.

2014-02-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (subst_vars): Change throwing of query_error_s
	to eval_error call. This is a leftover from when this was cloned
	from its counterpart in match.c. However, I can't think of a way
	this call can ever be reached.

2014-02-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (macro_form_p, macroexpand_1, macroexpand): New static
	functions.
	(eval_init): Registered new functions.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2014-02-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (unquotes_occur): Bugfix: we should not terminate
	the recursion early if we see a quote. This would be true if
	the only quotes were those generated by the parser based on
	calls to choose_quote. However, it breaks for something
	like an explicitly coded '(sys:quote ,form), which becomes
	(sys:quote (sys:quote ,form)), leaving a dangling unquote.

2014-02-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/faster-square-root (mp_sqrt): Bugfix: was computing square
	roots that were incorrect in the last digit/bit, because it was not
	generating the guess mask all the way down to bit zero. Also, added
	an early test to bail the loop when an the guess at the root happens
	to be right.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops: Refreshed.

	* mpi-patches/fix-ctype-warnings: Likewise.

	* mpi-patches/mpi-to-double: Likewise.

2014-02-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixing a long-running issue in the TXR pattern language: premature
	opening of files, prior to directives that actually need data.
	The documentation basically lied that this is the case: namely,
	the text "A file isn't opened until the query demands material from
	that file, and then the contents are read on demand, not all at
	once."   This is now a fact.

	* match.c (non_matching_directive_table): New global variable.
	(open_data_source): New static function. Contains an almost
	verbatim migration of the source-opening logic that used
	to be in match_files. The useless assignment to c->nil is gone,
	and c->data == t is explicitly tested for. Instead of assuming
	that only the @(next) directive does not need to have a data source
	open, the table of non-matching directives is consulted. Opening
	the data source is now skipped for numerous directives.
	(match_files): Call open_data_source within the loop. This
	means that even after processing numerous non-matching directives,
	we will still correctly set up the data lazy list.
	(dir_tables_init): Initialize non_matching_directive_table,
	protect from GC and populate with numerous directives.

	* txr.1: Improved documentation for @(next :args), and removed
	a description of the hack that a single @(next) at the top of the
	query suppressed the opening of the data source.

2014-02-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (env_hash): new function.
	(eval_init): Register env and env_hash functions.  Register prog_args
	and prog_args_full as *args* and *full-args*.

	* lib.c (timegm_hack): Invalidate env_list, after mucking with
	the environment via setenv and unsetenv.

	* txr.c (prog_args_full, prog_args): New global variables.
	(txr_main): Command-line processing converted to use TXR's
	library. Populates prog_args_full and prog_args.

	* txr.h (prog_args_full, prog_args): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented *args*, *full-args*, env and env-hash.

2014-02-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	The mode argument in some stream-opening functions becomes optional.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Change registration for open_file, open_tail
	and open_command.

	* stream.c (open_file, open_tail, open_command): mode_str argument
	defaulted.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2014-02-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (open_tail): Fix 2013-12-02 regression:
	seek_to_end_p argument being ignored, with the
	behavior being no initial seek to the end.

	* txr.1: Clarified the behavior of the seek-to-end-p
	option.

2014-02-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* combi.c (rperm_gen_full): Update ptail with return value
	of list_collect. This is not necessary for correctness, but it spares
	list_collect from having to search for the tail on each call.

2014-02-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 80

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES, txr.vim, dep.mk: Updated.

2014-02-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_args, op_defvar, op_defun, op_defmacro, op_modplace):
	Fix sybol misspelling.

2014-02-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register gensym function as the gensym
	intrinsic, rather than gensymv.
	Register gensym_counter as *gensym-counter*.

	* lib.c (gensym): Handle missing prefix argument by defaulting
	the prefix to "g".
	(gensymv): Function removed.

	* lib.h (gensymv): Declaration removed.

	* txr.1: Fixed omission: missing documentation for gensym.
	Documented *gensym-counter*.

2014-02-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand): Bugfix: do not expand any part of the macro
	form via expand_forms. This is completely wrong since only the
	macro knows what material is evaluated and what isn't.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_tree_case): Removed superfluous handling of
	nil parameter list; this is correctly handled by bind_macro_params.
	Added support for the colon symbol as an indication that
	the case is declined.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New destructuring operators.

	* eval.c (tree_case_s, tree_bind_s): New symbol variables.
	(bind_macro_params): Bugfix: inappropriate exception thrown when atom
	matched against parameter list. Bugfix: nil being returned when
	atom matches empty parameter list. Added support for a new convention:
	if loose_p is the colon keyword, then exceptions are not thrown
	for destructuring mismatches; nil is returned instad.
	(op_tree_case, expand_tree_cases, expand_tree_case, op_tree_bind):
	New static functions.
	(expand): Handle tree_case_s and tree_bind_s.
	(eval_init): Intern tree-case and tree-bind symbols.
	Register the corresponding operator functions op_tree_case and
	op_tree_bind under these symbols in op_table.

	* txr.1: Documented tree-case and tree-bind operators.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_macro_params): Bugfix: enforce mismatch on
	superfluous material.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	In the spirit of the previous hack, here is another hack to
	alleviate a long-standing pain: when an exception happens in
	TXR's library somewhere, the program dies without leaving
	a clue about what code was being evaluated when that happened.
	What we can do is have the evaluator publish the most recent
	compound form it has processed by stashing it in a variable.
	Then when an unhandled exception occurs, we can peek at that
	and try to pull out source location info.

	* eval.c (last_form_evaled): New variable.
	(do_eval): When evaluating a compound form, stash it in
	last_form_evaled.
	(eval_init): Protect last_form_evaled from gc.

	* eval.h (last_form_evaled): Declared.
	(eval_error_s): Existing variable declared.

	* unwind.c: Has to include "eval.h" for the above variable
	and "parser.h" for the source_loc function.
	(uw_throw): When an exception is unhandled, if 
	last_form_evaled has source info, add it to the diagnostic.
	But not if the exception is eval-error; because errors from
	the evaluators already have the info.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Nice idea: how about a function which walks the tree structure and
	back-fills some missing source code location info.  We apply this to
	macro expansions.  If some error occurs in expanded code, this way it
	is referenced to the line where the macro *call* occurs.
	Not only is this better than nothing, it may be better than tracing
	it to the macro definition. Ideally, we would have both places:
	("the error is in the code expanded from this macro, at this site").

	* eval.c (expand): Use rlcp_tree to back-fill source info in
	macro expansion by taking it from the unexpanded form.

	* parser.h (rlcp_tree): Declared.

	* parser.y (rlcp_tree): New function.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfixes: not propagating source loc info in quasiliterals.

	* eval.c (expand_quasi): Add some rlcp's here.

	* parser.y (o_var, quasi_items, o_elems_transform): Likewise.

2014-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand): Replace blatant tail calls with
	a backwards goto.

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_macro_params): Bugfix: the :whole parameter must
	capture the entire form, not just the arguments.
	(expand): Apply rlcp to the result of macro expansion, if it has
	not set up source code location.
	(eval_init): Register rlcp as intrinsic.

	* txr.1: Start of macro documentation. Documented rlcp.

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	First cut at implementation of macros.

	* eval.c (top_mb, defmacro_s, macro_time_s, whole_k, env_k): New global
	variables.
	(expand_params): Recurse to handle macro parameter lists too.
	(bind_macro_params, op_defmacro, expand_macro): New static functions.
	(expand): Evaluate defmacro forms and macro-time forms at expansion
	time. Recognize and expand macros (albeit not yet with proper lexical
	scoping: local bindings are not able to shadow a macro).
	(eval_init): Protect top_mb from GC and initialize it.
	Intern new symbols defmacro, macro-time, and :whole.
	Register defmacro operator in op_table.

	* match.h (env_k): Added declaration for existing external variable.

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: parameters of defun were not being treated by expander.
	They need to be since they can contain evaluable initforms for default
	arguments. Ditto with lambda; lambda parameters were being treated
	using expand_vars, which is not appropriate.

	* eval.c (expand_opt_params, expand_params): New static functions.
	(expand_vars): Bugfix: added some missing rlcp's to propagate
	line number info.
	(expand): Move lambda to separate case, and expand its params

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_args, op_modplace): Use ~s consistently
	in error messages.

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bindings_helper): Fixed misspelling of "symbol" in exception
	message.

2014-02-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	A trivial change in the UTF-8 decoder allows TXR to handle null bytes
	in text.

	* utf8.h (UTF8_ADMIT_NUL): New preprocessor symbol.
	(utf8_decoder): New member, flags.

	* utf8.c (utf8_decoder_init): Initialize flags to 0.
	(utf8_decode): If a null byte is encountered in the input,
	then convert it to 0xDC00, rather than keeping it as zero,
	unless flags contains UTF8_ADMIT_NUL.

	* txr.1: Document handling of null bytes.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_update): Avoid double cdr.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (inhash): Simplify with gethash_c.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Replacing acons_new_l and aconsq_new_l interfaces with ones
	that return the new or old cons cell rather than a pointer
	to its cdr field.

	* eval.c (transform_op): use of acons_new_l replaced with
	acons_new_c.

	* hash.c (struct hash): acons_new_l_fun member replaced
	with acons_new_c_fun.
	(make_hash, make_similar_hash): initialize acons_new_l_fun
	member using either acons_new_c or aconsql_new_c.
	(gethash_l): function becomes an inline in hash.h.
	(gethash_c): new function, based on gethash_l.
	(inhash, gethash_n): updated w.r.t struct hash change.

	* hash.h (gethash_c): declared.
	(gethash_l): becomes an inline wrapper for gethash_c.

	* lib.c (acons_new_l, aconsql_new_l): functions removed.
	(acons_new_c, aconsql_new_c): new functions.
	(obj_init): use gethash_c and rplacd instead of gethash_l
	and set.

	* lib.h (acons_new_l, aconsql_new_l): declarations removed.
	(acons_new_c, aconsql_new_c): declared.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (inhash): Simplify code with gethash_f.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered hash_update_1 as intrinsic.

	* hash.c (hash_update_1): New function.

	* hash.h (hash_update_1): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented hash-update-1.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (inhash): Rename local variable from new to new_p.
	This is consistent with usage elsewhere in the module,
	and more importantly, keeps our code C++.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (class_check): Bugfix: the function was assuming that
	the argument is a pointer type object, leading to a crash
	if given a fixnum integer or string literal.

2014-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register inhash as intrinsic.

	* hash.c (inhash): New function.

	* hash.h (inhash): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented inhash. Also, added surprisingly missing
	documentation for gethash!

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Different approach: optional arguments on hash-isec and hash-uni allow
	for more flexible joining of data from the hash tables.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Remove hash_guni and hash_gisec. Change
	registration for hash_uni and hash_isec to three arguments with
	one optional.

	* hash.c (hash_uni): Third parameter introduced, join_func.
	The default behavior changes: in the two argument case,
	clashing keys prefer the value from hash1 rather than hash2.
	For this reason, we now iterate over hash2 first, then hash1.
	(hash_guni): Removed.
	(hash_isec): Third parameter introduced, join_func.
	(hash_gisec): Removed.

	* hash.h (hash_uni, hash_isec): Declarations updated.
	(hash_guni, hash_gisec): Delarations removed.

	* txr.1: Documentation updated.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register hash_guni and hash_gisec as intrinsics.

	* hash.c (hash_guni, hash_gisec): New functions.
	(hash_isec): Bugfix: since gethash was naively used, keys in hash2
	associated with the value nil were erroneously omitted from the
	intersection.

	* hash.h (hash_guni, hash_gisec): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented new functions.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Disallow syntax like 1.0a, flagging it as
	an invalid floating-point token.  The problem is that 1a is allowed,
	for compatibility with other Lisp dialects (it is a symbol) whereas
	1.0a was scanning as 1.0 followed by a, which is inconsistent.
	Some Lisp dialects embedded dots in symbols, and allow 1.0a
	as a symbol token. We don't.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (struct hash): New member, equal_fun.
	(hash_equal_op): Short circuited logic: whenever we pull
	identical cells from either hash, we don't have to go
	through the pending lookaside list.
	(make_hash, make_similar_hash): Initialize new structure member.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_equal_op, hash_hash_op): New static functions.
	(hash_ops): New functions registered in table of operations.

	* txr.1: Documentation for equal function updated to explain
	how two hashes are equal.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Undoing bogus optimization, which can only work when objects
	are treated as immutable.

	* hash.c (last_equal_key, last_equal_hash): Variables removed.
	(equal_hash, hash_process_weak): All references to removed
	variables scrubbed.

2014-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (some_satisfy, all_satisfy, none_satisfy): Fix coding
	mistake from two commits ago leading to a regression.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register new functions posqual, posql,
	posq, pos, and pos_if as intrinsics.

	* lib.c (posqual, posql, posq, pos, pos_if): New functions.

	* lib.h (posqual, posql, posq, pos, pos_if): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Turn a require argument into an optional
	one for the functions some, all and none.

	* lib.c (some_satisfy, all_satisfy, none_satisfy): Add defaulting
	behavior for pred parameter.

	* txr.1: Document that the predicate function is optional
	in calls to some, all and none.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 79

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (if_fun): Bugfix: forgotten handling of optional
	alternative argument.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (subst_vars): Bugfix: results of expressions not
	treated in the same way as variables: lists not stringified,
	causing expansions with parentheses, and sometimes errors
	due to unhandled objects. Also, use tostringp instead of
	format for stringifying objects.
	stringifying object. Bugfix.k

	* match.c (subst_vars): Added comment similar to the one in
	the subst_vars of eval.c. Removed superfluous conversion code where the
	str variable is already known to be a string.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (apply): Fix regression in dwim operator: not handling
	nil object properly. Since dwim now trivially delegates to apply,
	apply must recognize nil.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* combi.c (comb_hash_while_fun, comb_hash_gen_fun, comb_hash): New
	static functions.
	(comb): Support hash tables.

	* hash.c (print_key_val): When values are nil, print in a more condensed
	way by omitting the second element. This notation is accepted as 
	input already by the parser.
	(hash_insert_pair): New function.

	* txr.1: Description of comb updated to indicate that it works over
	hashes.

2014-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (OBJS): New object file, combi.o.

	* dep.mk: Updated.

	* combi.c: New file.

	* combi.h: New file.

	* txr.vim: Regenerated.

2014-02-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rcomb_gen_fun_common): Streamlined implementation.
	Got rid of stack that is consed up on each call.

2014-02-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Relaxed behavior: don't throw errors for impossible permutations,
	but return an empty list.

	* eval.c (perm_init_common): Do not throw error; return a nil
	state if permutation length exceeds sequence length.
	(perm_vec, perm_list, perm_str): Check for null return from
	perm_init_common and return empty list.
	(k_conses): Do not throw error; return empty list.
	(comb_list_gen_fun): Check for nil value out of k_conses.
	(comb): For vectors and strings, check length against k and
	return nil if necessary. For lists, comb_list_gen_fun handles it.

	* txr.1: Section order rearranged, and updated.

2014-02-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rcomb_while_fun, rcomb_gen_fun_common,
	rcomb_list_gen_fun, rcomb_list, rcomb_vec_gen_fun, rcomb_vec,
	rcomb_str_gen_fun, rcomb_str, rcomb): New static functions.
	(eval_init): Register rcomb as intrinsic.

	* txr.1: Documented rcomb.

2014-02-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rperm, perm_str): Just in case, return a mutable empty
	string, rather than null_string, which is a literal.
	(k_conses, comb_while_fun, comb_gen_fun_common,
	comb_list_gen_fun, comb_list, comb_vec_gen_fun, comb_vec,
	comb_str_gen_fun, comb_str, comb): New static functions.
	(eval_init): Registered comb as instrinsic.

	* txr.1: Documented comb.

2014-02-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rperm_list, rperm_vec, rperm_str): n variable renamed
	to k, for consistency with rperm.
	(rperm): Likewise, and the behavior in the k == zero case is
	changed to return a single empty permutation.
	(perm_while_fun, perm_index, perm_gen_fun_common, perm_init_common,
	perm_vec_gen_fill, perm_vec_gen_fun, perm_vec, 
	perm_list_gen_fill, perm_list_gen_fun, perm_list, 
	perm_str_gen_fill, perm_str_gen_fun, perm_str, perm): New
	static functions.
	(eval_init): perm registered as intrinsic.

	* lib.c (vecref_l): Bugfix: allow negative indices, just like vecref.

	* txr.1: Updated documentation for rperm. Documented perm.

2014-02-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (vector, vec_set_length, cat_vec): When the vector size
	overflows the size_t type that is passed to malloc, throw an exception.

2014-02-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (nperm_while_fun, nperm_gen_fun, nperm_list,
	nperm_vec_gen_fun, nperm_vec, nperm_str_gen_fun, nperm_str, nperm): New
	static functions.
	(eval_init): nperm registered as intrinsic.

	* txr.1: Documented nperm function.

	Version 78

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

2014-02-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_grow, make_hash, make_similar_hash, copy_hash):
	Pass second argument to vector.

	* lib.c (vector): Takes additional argument specifying the value
	for the slots of the vector.
	(vector_list, sub_vec): Pass second argument to vector.

	* lib.h (vector): Declaration updated.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register vector as two-argument function
	with one required arg.
	
	* txr.1: Updated.

2014-02-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_dwim): Gutted down to just a few lines.
	Basically the dwim operator is just a Lisp-1 version of the call
	operator now. It doesn't have to do anything funny with non-function
	objects, since they are callable.

	* lib.c (chr_str, chr_str_set, vecref, vecref_l): Replace
	inappropriate internal assertions with error exceptions.

	* unwind.h (numeric_assert, range_bug_unless): Unused macros
	removed.

2014-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (generic_funcall): If a cons cell is passed as
	one argument to a sequence being used as a function, split it into two
	arguments. This is consistent with the DWIM operator behavior.

	* txr.1: Document callable objects.

2014-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Allow sequences and hashes to be called as functions.
	This is already supported in the DWIM operator.

	* eval.c (apply): If object isn't a function, gather the
	arguments into an array and delegate to generic_funcall.

	* lib.c (generic_funcall): Changed from static to external linkage.
	Supports sequences and hashes as functions. Error messages
	fixed not to refer to "funcall".
	(funcall, funcall1, funcall2, funcall3, funcall4): Do not throw
	exception if fun is not of FUN type; instead, delegate
	to generic_funcall. Error messages fixed not to refer to "funcall".

	* lib.h (generic_function): Declared.

	addressed.

2014-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bind_args): Support optional parameters in the
	form (sym initform present-p-sym).  Also, support the convention
	that a value of : explicitly passed for an optional argument produces
	the same behavior as if that argument value were missing.

	in format calls.

2014-02-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Tighten up environment visibility semantics of default argument
	init forms, while streamlining the implementation.

	* eval.c (bind_args): Get rid of opt_init_parm array hack;
	turns out we already have a useful function for extending an
	environment object, namely env_vbind: hitherto unused!  We now make a
	blank environment upfront and extend it destructively with env_vbind.
	Except that after evaluating an init form, we create a new environment:
	this is in case a lexical closure was made by the init form, in which
	event we don't want to be destructively manipulating the environment
	any more.

	* txr.1: Clarified.

2014-02-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Fix incorrect registration of
	list_star_intrinsic, diagnosed by compiler.

2014-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register vector_list function a second time
	under the name vec, as a variadic function.

	copy_hash, gethash_l, gethash, gethash_f, gethash_n, 
	hash_count, hash_next, hash_eql, hash_equal): Use
	num_fast instead of num.
	(make_hash): An attempt to make a weak-keys hash that has
	equal-based keys is nonsensical; it is now diagnosed with
	an exception. Use num_fast instead of num.
	(hash_process_weak): Call breakpt whenever the weak object(s) due to
	which entries are being deleted match the value in break_obj.
	Use num_fast instead of num.

	* parser.l (parse_init): Bugfix: the forms_to_ln_hash
	was equal-based, which makes no sense.

2014-02-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Export break_obj.

	* gc.c (break_obj): Change to external linkage.
	(mark): Use t variable instead of re-evaluating obj->t.type.

	* gc.h (break_obj): Declared.

2014-02-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (d): Disable garbage collection around the dump.
	It's importa for this function not to have the side effect
	of triggering garbage collection, when it is used for 
	debugging issues that show up under --gc-debug.

2014-01-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: remove stray debugging printf from the

	Do not color embedded decimal integers in symbols as integers.

	* txr.vim: Regenerated.

2014-01-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_op): When the variant is do, and the symbol
	is an operator, then suppress the addition of the rest
	parameter in the dotted cons position at the end of the form,
	since this mechanism for applying additional arguments is only
	supported by function calls, not by special forms. 

	* lib.h (and2, and3): New macros.

2014-01-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_op): Fix broken do operator. In the case of the do
	operator, we must feed the entire form to the expander, not the
	individual forms.  That is to say (do operator arg) must expand the
	form (operator arg), whereas (op fun arg) just expands the forms fun
	and arg individually.

2014-01-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 77

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

2014-01-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Default argument initializer scoping rule change, allowing
	things like (defun foo (s : (l (length s))) ...).
	Default arguments can be initialized by expressions that
	refer to the arguments.

	* eval.c (bind_args): By means of a local array, defer the evaluation
	of optional argument init forms until the lexical environment,
	including all the parameters, is captured. Then valuates the forms
	in the array, and set the variable values. 

	* txr.1: Clarify the new scoping rules.

2014-01-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered existing make_catenated_stream as
	intrinsic.

	* stream.c (cat_get_line, cat_get_char, cat_get_byte): Do not
	remove the last stream from the stream list, so that there is
	some stream object there which can take the unget-char or
	unget-byte operations.
	(cat_unget_byte, cat_unget_char): New static functions.
	(cat_stream_ops): unget_char and unget_byte function pointers
	filled in.

	* txr.1: Documented catenated-streams.

2014-01-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (struct stdio_handle): New member, is_rotated.
	Moved mode member down.
	(make_stdio_stream_common): Initialize is_rotated.
	(tail_strategy): Substantially rewritten in order to address
	a possible race condition, when a file is rotated.
	The issue is that even when the file disappears, or when the file has
	been replaced, we must continue reading from the old stream until the
	end, and only then can we switch to the newly rotated file.

2014-01-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (remove_path, rename_path): New functions.

	* stream.h (remove_path, rename_path): Declared.

	as intrinsics.

2014-01-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (meta_meta_p, meta_meta_strip): New static functions.
	(transform_op): Recognize compounded metas, and strip one level off.
	(eval_init): Intern sys:expand function so we have access to the
	form expander from TXR Lisp.

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Fix: wasn't rendering metanumbers.

	* parser.y (list): Support @ in front of anything. If it's an atom,
	treat it similarly to a metasymbol or metanumber.

	* txr.1: Documented meta-meta arguments in nested op.

	* genvim.txr, txr.vim: Support coloring for compounded meta syntax.
 
2014-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Lexing and parsing improvements, leaving things less hacky than before,
	albeit hacky.

	* parser.l (BSYM, NSYM): Regex definitions gone.
	(BT0, BT1, BT2, NT0, NT1, NT2): New regex definitions.
	(BTREG, BTKEY, NTREG, NTKEY): Rewritten, so that they cannot
	match a lone @ character as a symbol name.
	(grammar): Rules for returning METAPAR, METABKT and METAQUO
	are gone. Instead, we just recognize a @ in the NESTED
	and BRACED states and return it as a token.

	* parser.y (METAPAR, METABKT, METAQUO): Token types removed.
	(meta_expr): Nonterminal symbol removed.
	('@'): New token type.
	(list): Quotes and splices handling removed from this rule.
	The new token '@' is handled here, on the other hand, because
	there are places that reference the list rule that need to support
	@ expressions.
	(n_expr): Reference to meta_expr removed. Quote, unquote and splice
	added here.
	(yybadtoken): Removed references to METAPAR, METABKT and METAQUO.

	* txr.vim, genvim.txr: There can now be whitespace in TXR Lisp
	like @ (a b c) and @ [1 2 3].

2014-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (yybadtoken): Handle METAQUO in switch.

2014-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (reduce_left, reduce_right): changing the behavior so that
	the initial value is optional. this creates the possibility that
	the effective list of operands is empty, in which case the function
	must support a call with no arguments, just like in the common lisp
	reduce.

	* txr.1: rewrote reduce-left and reduce-right documentation.

2014-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Bugfix: there may be
	additional expressions forms in (sys:var <sym>) after
	the sym. These were not being printed. Such syntax occurs
	often in the TXR pattern language.

2014-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* regex.c (match_regex_right): New function.

	* regex.h (match_regex_right): Declared.

2014-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implementing more correct treatment of meta forms 
	like @[...] and @(...) occurring in the TXR pattern language.

	The previous behavior is that the parser always expands the interior
	of these forms when they occur. This is wrong.

	These forms only denote TXR Lisp (and so require expansion) when they
	occur in a directive, inside a sub-expression that is not already known
	to be Lisp.

	For instance in @(do @(op foo)), the inner @(op foo) should not be
	subject to expansion. The reason that the argument forms of @(do)
	are TXR Lisp. The @(op foo) form denotes (sys:expr foo), and that
	operator currently has no meaning; and so we should not expand it.
	The previous, buggy behavior would turn the @(op ..) into 
	a @(lambda ...).

	Another example is @(bind a @(list @(op foo))) where @(list ...)
	denotes TXR Lisp and so the interior of the form should be expanded.
	However, the @(op foo) should not be expanded into @(lambda ...)

	Expanding @(...) forms is not currently harmful, but it interferes
	with code that wants to use the @(...) syntax for its own use,

	The solution involves adding shims in the parser so that the expansion
	is only applied when expressions are reduced to the top level
	within a directive, and then to walk the expressions, looking for
	the @ syntax and expanding only the outermost occurrence thereof.

	* parser.y (expand_meta): New static function.
	(n_exprs n_expr): New nonterminal symbols.
	(elem): The arguments of the list elem (representing a generic
	directive) now need to be put through expand_meta when it is not
	@(do ...) or @(require ...).
	(list): Use n_exprs instead of exprs.
	(meta_expr): Do not call expand, and use n_expr(s) instead of expr(s).
	(exprs, expr): These rules no become just a shim which expands
	the outer-most metas. The actual parsing is represented by n_expr
	and n_exprs ("n" stands for nested), which behave just like the
	old expr and exprs.

2014-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Sigh; more lexical-syntactic hacks. This adds handling
	for the @' combination, as in @(bind a @'(foo ,bar))

	* parser.l: Handle the new METAQUO token.

	* parser.y (METAQUO): New token.
	(meta_expr): New "METAQUO expr" case. Added missing METABKT
	error handling case.

	lookup.

2014-01-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: @(require ...) not expanding forms.

	* eval.c (expand_forms): Static function becomes external.
	(expand_form): Remove case which handles do_s.

	list_collect_* macros to functions.

	* lib.c (copy_list): Switch from list_collect* macros to functions.

	that list_collect_append calls copy_list in places, it triggered
	runaway recursion.
	(make_like): Bugfix: list_vector was used instead of vector_list.
	(to_seq, list_collect, list_collect_nconc, list_collect_append): New
	functions.

	merge, set_diff, env): Switch from list_collect* macros to functions.
	(replace_str, replace_vec): Allow single item replacement sequence.

	* lib.h (to_seq): Declared.
	(list_collect, list_collect_nconc, list_collect_append): Macros
	removed, replaced by function declarations of the same name.
	These functions return the new ptail since they cannot assign
	to it, requiring all uses to be updated to do the assignment
	of the returned value.
	(list_collect_decl): Use val rather than obj_t *.

	* match.c (vars_to_bindings, h_coll, subst_vars, extract_vars,
	extract_bindings, do_output_line, do_output, v_gather, v_collect):

	evaluation like (op or @1 42) or (op if (eq @1 foo) bar xyzzy)
	is possible.

	function lookup to favor operators. This is important since
	there are several operators now which are also functions.
	(if_fun, or_fun, and_fun): New static functions.
	(eval_init): New functions registered as intrinsics.

	* txr.1: Documented that if, and, or exist as both functions

	string_in_ops, byte_in_ops, string_out_ops, strlist_out_ops,
	dir_ops, cat_stream_ops): Structure definition updated

	* txr.1: Documented.

2014-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (put_byte): Bugfix: was checking whether the put_char
	virtual function is not null, rather than put_byte.

2014-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix in regex char ranges affecting ranges whose upper end
	corresponds to the high bit of a bitmap cell: for instance
	the character \x7f when the cell size is 32 bits.

	* regex.c (BITCELL_ALL1): Unused macro removed.
	(BITCELL_BIT): New macro to replace occurrences of a repeated
	expression.
	(CHAR_SET_INDEX, CHAR_SET_BIT): Updated to use BITCELL_BIT.
	(L0_fill_range): Bugfix: the mask1 calculation was producing all-zero

	mask.

2014-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 74

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	the debug-disabled stub function needs six arguments.

2014-01-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Some bignum-related optimizations

	* arith.c (plus, minus, mul, trunc): Optimize cases

	* eval.c: Include arith.h.
	(eval_init): Register cum_norm_dist as intrinsic.

	* txr.1: Documented cum-norm-dist.

2014-01-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Detect platforms which don't reveal declarations
	in C headers which are extensions to standard C, like popen or fileno,
	in response to standard feature selection macros like -D_POSIX_SOURCE.
	MinGW and Cygwin are offenders.  These platforms hide the declarations
	when gcc is in -ansi mode, by testing for __STRICT_ANSI__. Turns out,
	however, that -U__STRICT_ANSI__ on the gcc command line strips this
	away, causing the declarations to be revealed.

	* lib.c, parser.l, stream.c, utf8.c: Removed the declarations which
	compensated for the above problem. Yippee!  Fuck you, stupid Cygwin
	troglodytes, and the MinGW horse you rode in on.
	http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-10/msg00131.html

2014-01-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Renaming lisp-parse to read; lisp-parse
	is retained as an obsolescent synonym. All arguments become optional.

	* parser.l (lisp_parse): Handle nil source.

	* txr.1: Updated.

014-01-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (do_txeval): Lift an annoying restriction in the pattern
	language's expression evaluator. Whereas TXR Lisp expressions can be
	used int the pattern language, preceded by @, it was not possible
	to evaluate TXR Lisp variables this way. So instead of @var,
	some clumsy trick had to be used like @(identity var). This is not
	necessary any more. Code like @(next @*stdin*) will now work.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2014-01-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Generate HAVE_VALGRIND as #define-d to 1, rathern
	than just fdefined.

	* gc.c: Use #if HAVE_VALGRIND instaed of #ifdef HAVE_VALGRIND,
	consistently with other HAVE_* config variables.

	* lib.c: Likewise.

	* lib.h: Likewise.

	* txr.c: Likewise.

	* txr.h: Likewise.

2014-01-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix broken Json parsing test case on MinGW.

	* stream.c (vformat): Fix incorrect code for normalizing
	exponent fields in the output of sprintf's floating-point
	conversion. For ~e, the logic would let through a leading zero.
	For ~a/~s conversion, it was comparing to 0 instead of '0',
	not squashing leading zeros at all.

2014-01-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c: Eliminate useless #else section containing #error

2013-01-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Long overdue MinGW port maintenance.

	* Makefile: Use new EXE variable from config.mk.

	* configure (exe, have_windows_h): New variables.
	Handle situations with .exe suffix; on MiGW, the rm command
	doesn't work on executables if the .exe suffix is not given.
	New tests for localtime_r and gmtime_r.

	* lib.c: Supply declarations which are missing on MinGW because
	we use gcc -ansi, because MinGW doesn't follow established conventions
	like -D_POSIX_SOURCE.  Supply definitions for gmtime_r, localtime_r,
	setenv and unsetenv.

	* parser.l: Supply declarations which are missing on MinGW.

	* signal.h (async_sig_enabled): Declare differently based on
	HAVE_POSIX_SIGS.
	Misspelled typedef fixed in the code for !HAVE_POSIX_SIGS
	that has hitherto not been compiled.
	(sig_mask): Wrap declaration in #ifdef HAVE_POSIX_SIGS because
	it relies on sigset_t.

	* stream.c: Supply declarations which are missing on MinGW.
	Include <windows.h> if we have it. 
	(sleep): Define for Windows.
	(statf): Handle missing st_blksize and st_blocks members in struct
	stat.
	(stream_init): Handle numerous missing S_* macros.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2014-01-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	The lisp-parse function can now be called multiple times
	on the same stream to extract multiple objects; the requirement
	that the stream must hold exactly one complete Lisp object
	with no following material is now lifted.

	* parser.l (YY_INPUT): Modified the macro so that it reads no more
	than one character. Though this probably makes the lexer less
	efficient, it gives us the important property that the lexer does
	not scan ahead into the input stream, hogging data into its buffer
	which is then destroyed. This is essential if the lisp-parse function
	is to support multiple calls to pull objects one by one out of
	a stream.

	* parser.y (spec): Use YYACCEPT in the SECRET_ESCAPE_E clause for
	pulling a single expression out of the token stream. YYACCEPT
	is a trick for not invoking the $accept : spec . $end production
	which is implicitly built into the grammar, and which causes
	a token of lookahead to occur.  This allows us to read a full
	expression without stealing any further token: but only if the
	grammar is structured right.
	(exprs): This phrase structure now handles the DOTDOT syntax.
	There is no such thing as an expr DOTDOT expr expression any more;
	it is in the list syntax (and not supported in the dot position).
	(expr): Remove DOTDOT syntax.

	* txr.1: Updated description of .. syntax, and relaxed the description
	of lisp-parse since it now allows multiple calls to extract
	multiple objects.

2014-01-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_load): Call yylex_destroy after yyparse, so we don't
	have stray scanner state possibly interfering with a subsquent
	parse job.

2014-01-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* genvim.txr: Add forgotten until and last keywords.
	
	* txr.vim: Regenerated.

2013-12-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Merry C++mas!

	* configure: Avoid using "new" as identifier in signals test case.

	* signal.c (set_sig_handler): Fix warning about { 0 } initializer.
	(sig_mask): Avoid using "new" as identifier.


2013-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixing a bug and performance issue.

	Problem: we are using sigsetjmp but with a jmp_buf structure;
	it requires sigjmp_buf!

	Performance issue: sigsetjmp is a dog which makes system calls.
	Solution: let's roll our own cached version of sigprocmask which
	only calls the real sigprocmask when the mask changes. Then
	our extended_setjmp will just use regular setjmp, plus our own
	custom signal saving and restoring based on the cached version.

	* signal.c (sig_blocked_cache): New variable.
	(set_sig_handler): Use our sig_mask instead of sigprocmask.
	(mem_set_bits, mem_clr_bits): New static functions.
	(sig_mask): New function.

	* signal.h (extended_jmp_buf): New member, blocked.
	(extended_setjmp): save blocked signals by peeking into
	sig_blocked_cache, and restore using sig_mask.
	(sig_blocked_cache, sig_mask): Declared.

2013-12-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	no effect if the variable already exists.

	* txr.1: Documented defvar and lisp-parse.

2013-12-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (intern): fix the previous diagnostic bug once more with more
	feeling.

	* parser.l (grammar): Recognize package prefixes in symbol tokens.
	Got rid of special rule for handling lone colon.

	* parser.y (sym_helper): Catch undefined package as a parsing 
	error rather allowing intern function to throw exception.

2013-12-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Changing the tokenizer to get rid of IDENT, KEYWORD and METAVAR
	token categories, replaced by a single one called SYMTOK.
	Package prefixes are now recognized and processed in tokens.

	* lib.c (delete_package): Fix problem in no-such-package
	error case: it would always report nil as the name.
	(intern): Fix nonsensical error message: in the no-such-package case it
	would report that the symbol exists already.

	* parser.l (grammar): Occurences of KEYWORD, METAVAR, and IDENT
	scrubbed. All rules reporting any of these now return
	SYMTOK. The main one of these is greatly simplified.

	* parser.y (sym_helper): New function.
	(char_from_name): const qualifier inside param's type declaration.
	(grammar): IDENT, KEYWORD and METAVAR tokens are gone.
	New token SYMTOK. Grammar refactored around SYMTOK and using
	the new sym_helper function.
	(char_from_name): Updated.

2013-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Support for parsing Lisp expression out of strings and streams.
	New catenated streams make the Yacc hack possible.

	* syslog.c (syslog_get_prop): Report "syslog" as
	stream name.

2013-12-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* signal.c (sig_handler): Pass two arguments to signal
	handler rather than 1. The new argument is the value t,
	telling the handler that it's asynchronously invoked in
	a real signal context. If the signal handler returns
	true, then mark it deferred so that it can re-trigger
	in a synchronous context.
	(sig_check): Pass nil as a the second argument to signal handlers,
	indicating that they are synchronously called, not
	in a signal handler context.

	* txr.1: Added documentation.

2013-12-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* signal.c (set_sig_handler): Disable signals around this
	function because it manipulates the mask of deferred
	signals which can also be manipulated by an async signal.

	* signal.c (set_sig_handler): Clear the deferred flag
	for a signal that is being set to ignored or default.

	* signal.h: New file.

2013-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	program was made all the way to an executable.

2013-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Fix warnings in test cases for HAVE_FORK_STUFF

	* eval.c (eval_init): Update registration of regex-compile
	to reflect that it has two arguments now.

	* parser.y (grammar): Update calls to regex_compile to
	pass two arguments. Since we don't expect regex_compile to
	parse, we specify the error stream as nil.
	(spec): The "secret syntax" for a regex is simplified
	not to include the slashes.  This provides better diagnostics for
	unterminated syntax and requires less string processing to generate.
	Also, the form returned doesn't have the regex symbol
	consed onto it, which parse_regex just throws away.

	* regex.c (regex_compile): Now takes a stream argument.

	* regex.h (regex_compile): Declaration updated.

	* txr.1: Updated

2013-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New lexical syntax added which returns SECRET_ESCAPE_R.

	* parser.y (SECRET_ESCAPE_R): New token.
	(spec): Added syntactic variant which lets us
	smuggle a regex into the parser easily.

	* stream.c:x (std_null): New global variable.
	(null_stream_print): New static function.
	(null_ops): New static structure.
	(make_null_stream): New function.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Call yylex_destroy after parsing the program now
	that I know about this function; this can free up some memory.

2013-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (stdio_set_prop): Fix reversed boolean.

2013-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (tail_strategy): Execute the strategy code also
	in the case that the stream's FILE * handle is null. This handles
	opening the file for the first time.
	(make_stdio_stream_common): Do not use the FILE * handle if it is null.
	(open_tail): Do not open the file immediately and error out.
	This is undesirable because log files might not exist at the time
	open_tail is called on them. Instead, produce a stream which contains
	a null file handle, and use tail_strategy to poll for the file
	to come into existence.

	* utf8.c (w_freopen): Just in case freopen doesn't like a null
	pointer for the existing stream, use fopen instead if that is the case.

2013-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* genvim.txr: Missing catch and finally keywords added.

	* txr.vim: Regenerated.

	debug_check calls are the culprit triggering lookahead
	in lazy lists. Changing the semantics of the data argument
	so that it can just be the list.

	* debug.c (debug): If data is a cons, then replace it with
	the first item.

	* match.c (match_files): Pass c.data to debug_check, rather
	than the value of if2(consp(c.data), car(c.data)) which accesses
	car(c.data) whether or not we are debugging.
	(match_fun): Likewise.

2013-12-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Steps toward fixing an issue: lazy list readahead.
	The problem is that accurate lazy lists are not suitable for
	real time use, where we want the TXR program to respond immediately
	to matching some datum.

	I'm implementing a simple, naive variant of lazy stream lists
	which simply populates the lazy cons by reading from the stream when
	the car or cdr fields are accessed. This type of stream can never
	be nil (empty list) even if the file is empty; in that case
	it will be (nil) and in general, it will have a spurious nil
	item at the end instead of ending in a string.
	(An adjustment was made in match.c to detect this; more 
	will be needed.)

	I'm adding attributes to streams so streams can now have a
	"real-time" attribute. When a lazy string list is constructed over
	a real-time stream, the simple implementation is used.
	File streams are automatically real-time if (on Unix) they are tied
	to tty streams. Tail streams are also real-time. 

	More work is needed to achieve the goal of this change,
	but this is a big step in the right direction.

	* configure: Detect isatty function.

	* lib.c (simple_lazy_stream_func): New static function.
	(lazy_stream_cons): Use simple implementation for real-time streams.

	* match.c (match_files): Do not call match_line_completely
	with a data line that is nil (as a result of simple lazy list
	over a real-time stream). A nil item in a lazy list of strings
	is treated as eof.

	* stream.c (real_time_k): New symbol variable.
	(struct strm_ops): New members: get_prop, set_prop.
	(struct stdio_handle): New member: is_real_time.
	(stdio_get_prop, stdio_set_prop): New static function.
	(stdio_ops, tail_ops, pipe_ops): stdio_get_prop and
	stdio_set_prop funtions wired in.
	(make_stdio_stream_common): Attribute streams as real-time
	if they are tty devices.
	(make_tail_stream): Tail streams are real-time attributed.
	(stream_set_prop, real_time_stream_p): New functions.
	(stream_init): Initialize real_time_k.

	* stream.h (real_time_k): Declared.
	(real_time_stream_p, stream_set_prop): Likewise.

	* lib.c (make_time): We must subtract from the 1-12
	month for the tm_mon member of struct tm; we
	were adding 1 instead.

2013-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (tail_calc): New function
	(tail_strategy): Handle the situation when the file disappears. We

	(tail_ops): New static structure.
	(make_stdio_stream_common): New static structure.
	(make_stdio_stream, make_pipe_stream): These functions lose the input
	and output parameters, which ended up never used. Reimplemented
	in terms of new common function.
	(make_tail_stream): New function.
	(make_pipevp_stream): Reimplemented in terms of new common function.

2013-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_load): Bugfix: bindings were propagated in only one of two
	subcases of a successful load.  This bug means that a loaded TXR
	sub-query was not reliably able to bind variables that are then visible
	to subsquent directives in the parent.  

2013-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix for uninitialized struct member curfiles in the match context.
	This is used for reporting the current match location in debug traces.

	* match.c (mf_all): Takes new argument curfiles
	and initializes the match_files_ctx member of the same name.
	(do_match_line, mf_from_ml, match_filter, match_fun, extract):
	Pass curfile to ml_all.

2013-11-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 70

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2013-11-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Nasty bug fixed: @(accept) from inside a @(collect) was found not to
	propagate bindings. The culprit?  The bindings_coll variable in the
	v_collect function being indeterminate by the well-documented and
	understood action of setjmp.  Marking the bindings_coll variable
	volatile instantly fixed it.  I reviewed this code to find any other
	instance of this oversight.

	* match.c (v_skip, v_collect): Mark some local variable volatile:
	precisely those which are used after possibly returning via an
	unwind, and which might have been modified since setting up
	the unwind block.

2013-11-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* genvim.txr: Handle symbols whose C names end with _star_s,
	and also ones with underscores.

	* txr.vim: Updated.

2013-10-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (clean): depends on conftest.clean
	(conftest.clean): New target.

	* configure: Use "make conftest.clean" to clean up conftest stuff. Note
	that there was a bug here: brace expansion was used, but the shell is
	/bin/sh, so conftest.err wasn't being removed.

2013-10-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix 2013-10-06 regression in op syntax.  This happens when a @var
	syntax appears in an op form, crashing the expander with infinite
	recursion at program load time, before the code is run.

	* eval.c (transform_op): The fi == var check to handle a
	trailing op variable in the dot position of a form
	needs to ensure that it really is @<num> type var, and
	not the @<sym> type for instance.

2013-10-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix jaw-dropping bug introduced on 2009-11-15, first affecting
	the 022 release.

	Efficient string literal objects (tag bits 11) were introduced on that
	day.  
	
	The null_string object was changed to a literal, and that object is
	efficiently returned by some string manipulation functions in cases
	when it is obvious that the result is an empty string.

	However, the LIT type code was not added to a switch statement in
	the variable matching code, which continued to recognize only the
	type STR as a string, to this day.

	A test case for this is
	
	    echo ":x" | ./txr -c "@x:@x" -

	which results in an "unsupported object in spec" error.

	* match.c (h_var): Use stringp to test for string rather than
	type(..) == STR. Add LIT and LSTR to the switch statement
	so that literals an lazy strings are handled if they occur.
	(do_output_line): Add LIT and LSTR to switch.

2013-10-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* genvim.txr: Include syntactic directives which aren't extracted from
	sources because actions aren't registered for them.

	* txr.vim: Regenerated.

2013-10-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Ouch! Turns out the code base has numerous unintended
	deviations from C90, like mixed declations and
	statements. GCC doesn't diagnose these without the
	--pedantic flag.

	* configure: GCC's --ansi flag should be spelled -ansi.

	* lib.c (split_str, obj_print): Reorder declaration before statements.
	(make_sym): Fix similar problem by eliminating a statement.
	(funcall1, funcall2, funcall3, funcall4): Use assignment to initialize
	local array with non-constant elements.  This is actually good for
	performance because we only initialize those parts of the array that
	we use.

	* lib.h (struct func): Change functype member to unsigned,
	since enum-typed bitfields are a GCC extension.

	* match.c (ml_all, mf_all): Use assignments to initialize local
	struct with non-constants.
	(do_txeval, v_collect): Slightly revise unwinding macrology with help
	of new macros to avoid mixing declarations and statements.
	(spec_bind): Removed spurious semicolon from macro expansion.
	(v_gather): Reorder two lines to avoid mixed decls and
	statements.
	(match_filter): Move declaration of ret a few lines up, ahead of
	statements.

	* unwind.c (uw_pop_until): New function.

	* unwind.h (uw_pop_until): Declared.
	(uw_mark_frame, uw_fast_return): New macros.

	(transform_op): Handle dotted lists ending in @rest
	or @<num>.

	so that all 1 through n are in the list.
	Trailing rest is now added under different
	conditions.

	* lib.c (do_iff): Give thenfun the same
	behavior on nil that elsefun enjoys.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2013-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New feature: :vars argument in repeat and rep directives in an output
	block, for specifying variables to include in iteration whose
	presence repeat is not able to deduce.

	* match.c (extract_bindings): New argument, vars, specifies
	additional variables to consider.
	(do_output_line, do_output): Process :vars argument of repeat
	and rep directive.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2013-08-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* filter.c, utf8.c: Tabs changed to spaces. For some reason, filter.c
	used 4 space tabs and utf8.c used 8 space tabs, inconsistently.

2013-07-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Added lazy-stringp. Changing names of length-str-{gt,ge,lt,le}
	to be consistent with the >, >=, < and <= functions.

	* lib.c (lazy_stream_func): Greatly simplified implementation.
	The lazy list now continues by means of recursing via 
	an optimized version of lazy_stream_cons called lazy_stream_cont.
	The environment structure is simplified to just hold the next item,
	rather than a pointless list. The pointless setting of lcons->lc.func
	to nil is also removed; this is always done by the caller.
	(lazy_stream_cont): New static function, similar to lazy_stream_cons,
	but optimized by not consing up a new function and new environment
	cell.
	(lazy_stream_cons): The environment for the update function
	is simplified to just a single cons.

	optional.

	* txr.1: Documented random functions as well as range and range*

2013-05-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* RELNOTES: Updated in preparation for release.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Expose delete-package, rehome-sym
	and packagep.

	* lib.c (make_package, intern): use ~s formatting for package name in
	error message.
	(packagep, delete_package, rehome_sym): New functions.

	* lib.h (packagep, delete_package, rehome_sym): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented process functions and packages.

2013-01-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2013-01-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (help): Help text updated.
	(debug): Fix conflicting command assignment.
	Show form is now 'o'.

2012-10-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (int_str): Fix gaping bug introduced by previous commit,
	which could have been caught by running the regression test suite.
	The revised function was returning small integers as bignums.

2012-10-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (string_lt): Bugfix: wcscmp returns some value less than zero,
	not specifically -1.

2012-10-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/config-types: Include the header as "config.h"
	rather than "../config.h" because the dependency generation script
	checks for this as a special case and treats it relative to the
	build directory.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2012-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (bignum_from_long): New function.

	* arith.h (bignum_from_long): Declared.

	* lib.c (int_str): Streamlined. Only use mp_read_radix in the case when
	wcstol fails, because now we have bignum_from_long to handle all values
	of long. Ensure that the bignum is normalized, in case it falls in the
	fixnum range (does not happen on our usual platforms). 

2012-09-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c: Allow the test form of a for loop to be omitted,
	defaulting to a true test, allowing an infinite loop to
	be expressed as (for () () () ...).

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* RELNOTES: Correct incorrect 2011 years on all 2012 dates. 
	How did that happen?

2012-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (apply): Fix in error message: hard coded "apply" instead
	of using ctx_form.

2012-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: internal funcall functions not handling functions
	with optional arguments.

	* lib.c (generic_funcall): New static function, based on apply
	from eval.c.
	(funcall, funcall1, funcall2, funcall3, funcall4): If the function
	being called has optional arguments, then go through generic_funcall.

2012-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (logand): Fix incorrect return value.

2012-09-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (logtest): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered logtest.
	Registered s-ifmt, s-iflnk, s-ifreg, s-ifblk, s-ifdir,
	s-ifchr, s-ififo, s-isuid, s-isgid, s-isvtx, s-irwxu,
	s-irusr, s-iwusr, s-ixusr, s-irwxg, s-irgrp, s-iwgrp,
	s-ixgrp, s-irwxo, s-iroth, s-iwoth, s-ixoth variables.

	* lib.h (logtest): Declared.

	* stream.c (s_ifmt, s_ifsock, s_iflnk, s_ifreg, s_ifblk,
	s_ifdir, s_ifchr, s_ififo, s_isuid, s_isgid, s_isvtx, s_irwxu, s_irusr,
	s_iwusr, s_ixusr, s_irwxg, s_irgrp, s_iwgrp, s_ixgrp, s_irwxo, s_iroth,
	s_iwoth, s_ixoth): New global variables.

	* stream.h (s_ifmt, s_ifsock, s_iflnk, s_ifreg, s_ifblk,
	s_ifdir, s_ifchr, s_ififo, s_isuid, s_isgid, s_isvtx, s_irwxu, s_irusr,
	s_iwusr, s_ixusr, s_irwxg, s_irgrp, s_iwgrp, s_ixgrp, s_irwxo, s_iroth,
	s_iwoth, s_ixoth): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented logtest and s-* variables for stat,
	as well as open-file and open-directory.

2012-09-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Slight change in ~s directive. For a floating
	point integer, .0 is now always shown if the precision is not given,
	or if it is given and nonzero.  Previous behavior of ~s was add .0 only
	when a precision is not specified. The new behavior is more
	sensible and consistent with documentation.

	* txr.1: Typo fixed in related documentation.

2012-09-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (comp_trunc, logcomp): logcomp renamed to lognot,
	consistent with Common Lisp.

	* lib.h (logcomp): Declaration updated.

2012-09-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (highest_significant_bit): New static function.
	(comp_clamp): Bugfix: avoid shifting left into sign bit. Function
	renamed to comp_trunc.
	(logtrunc, ash): New functions.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered logtrunc and ash intrinsics.

	* lib.h (logtrunc, ash): Declared.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops (s_highest_bit_mp): Forward declaration for
	added.
	(mp_clamp_comp): Bugfix in handling remainder bits. Function
	renamed to mp_trunc_comp.
	(mp_trunc, mp_shift): New functions.

2012-09-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (highest_significant_bit): New static function.
	(comp_clamp): Bugfix: avoid shifting left into sign bit.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops (s_highest_bit_mp): Forward declaration for
	added.
	(mp_comp_clamp): Bugfix in handling remainder bits.
	(mp_clamp, mp_shift): New functions.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops:  Bugfixes: mp_2comp is extended to properly
	allow arbitrarily wide complements (which causes the code to access
	beyond the a argument's digits array). A similar fix is applied in
	the new mp_clamp_comp function.  Incorrect initializations of mp_int
	fixed in all the logic functions: mp_init was used instead of
	mp_init_size.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (logand, logior, logxor): Bugfix: result needs to be
	normalized, otherwise we end up with fixnum-range bignums.
	(comp_clamp): New function.
	(logcomp): Changed to two argument form. If second argument
	is present (not nil) then call comp_clamp.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Change registration of logcomp to allow
	optional argument.

	* lib.h (logcomp): Declaration updated.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops:  New mp_clamp_comp function implemented.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (logcomp): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): logcomp registered as intrinsic.

	* lib.h (logcomp) declared.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops: Fixed bugs in mp_xor. Implemented mp_comp.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Starting work on adding bit operations. The semantics is that
	negative integers behave as an "infinite bit two's complement".

	* arith.c (logand, logor, logxor): New functions.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic functions logand, logior, logxor.

	* lib.h (logand, logor, logxor): Declared.

	* mpi-patches/series: New patch, add-bitops.

	* mpi-patches/add-bitops: New file.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Fix bug in ~x format directive for printing
	integers in hex. When we use the printf's %x conversion specifiers for
	fixnums, we get incorrect results when the values are negative, because
	the argument is actually treated as an unsigned integer. 
	The end result is that (format t "~x" -1) produces FFFFFFFF
	rather than -1. Also, merged together mindless code duplication.

2012-09-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Implemented hexadecimal integer constants.
	These will be very useful since bit operations are about
	to be implemented.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-09-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsics: make-similar-hash, copy-hash,
	hash-uni, hash-diff, hash-isec.

	* hash.c (make_similar_hash, copy_hash, hash_uni, hash_diff,
	hash_isec): New functions.

	* hash.h (make_similar_hash, copy_hash, hash_uni, hash_diff,
	hash_isec): Declared.

	* txr.1: Updated.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for these new functions.

2012-09-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Added test for <sys/stat.h>

	* eval.c: New intrinsic functions "stat" and "prop".

	* stream.c: Include <sys/stat.h> if we have it.
	(w_stat, statf): New functions.
	(val dev_k, ino_k, mode_k, nlink_k, uid_k,
	val gid_k, rdev_k, size_k, blksize_k, blocks_k;
	val atime_k, mtime_k, ctime_k): New sybol variables.
	(stream_init): Intern new keywords symbols.

	* stream.h (statf): Declared.

	* txr.1: prop documented. Stub for stat created.

2012-09-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): new instrinsic function /= registered.

	* lib.c (numneqv): New function.

	* lib.h (numneqv): Declared.

	* txr.1: New function documented.

2012-09-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_collect): Bug in processing of @(last) directive.
	When a match for the @(last) material occured at the end of data,
	c->data was being mistakenly set to nil rather than t before breaking
	out of the loop, wreaking havoc. This is not a regression; this
	was there since the inception of @(last) between versions 38 and 39.

2012-09-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented string library.

2012-09-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Follow function renames.

	* hash.c (make_hash): Likewise.

	* lib.c (assq): Renamed to assql for consistency.
	(aconsq_new): Renamed to aconsql_new.
	(aconsq_new_l): Renamed to aconsql_new_l.
	(alist_remove_test): Use equal rather than eq. Association lists
	use equal equality by default.
	(alist_nremove): Use memqual rather than memq.
	(alist_nremove1): Use equal rather than eq.
	(merge): Bugfix: unnecessary consing caused by using append
	instead of nconc on list pieces that are already destructively
	chopped up. This has implications for the efficiency of sort
	over lists!
	(multi_sort_less): Implement key functions.
	(multi_sort): Interface change: arguments rearranged, and new
	argument to specify key functions.

	* lib.h (assoc, assq, assql, aconsq_new, aconsq_new_l): Declarations
	renamed.
	(multi_sort): Declaration updated.

	* txr.1: Documented alist library, list sorting and completed
	documenting lazy library.

	* txr.vim: multi-sort highlighted.

2012-09-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Lots of new documentation. Major rearrangement of document,
	with new headings.

2012-09-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (symbol_function): Bugfix: return the function rather than
	the whole binding.

2012-09-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Minor corrections, and documented most stream functions,
	except directory-related ones.

2012-09-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented print, pprint, tostring and tostringp.

2012-08-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Bugfix: under the ~a and ~s directives,
	apply field formatting to the object not only if a nonzero width has
	been specified, but also if precision has been specified.

	* txr.1: documented stream global variables and format.

2012-08-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand): Bugfix: failure to handle regular
	expression syntax, resulting in (set ...) syntax being regarded as
	assignment (due to another recent change).

2012-08-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented chain, andf, orf and iff.

2012-08-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_intrinsic): Bugfix: take the expanded form instead
	of throwing it away.
	(expand): Recurse into expand_place for (set ...) forms.

	* txr.1: Documented eval.

2012-08-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented all functions related to hashing.

2012-08-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (multi_sort_less): Fixing semantics of return value. Individual
	sorted lists are returned, rather than a list of zipped tuples.

2012-08-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (multi_sort_less): Change the semantics so that when the
	list of the functions is empty, the left item is considered less
	than the right, thereby preserving the order.

2012-08-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (mapcarv): Changed to external linkage.

	* eval.h (mapcarv): Declaration added.

	* txr.1: stub section added.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered open-command and open-process
	intrinsics. open-pipe is now deprecated but stays for backward
	compatibility as a synonym for open-command.

	* stream.c (open_pipe): Renamed to open_command.
	(open_pipevp): Renamed to open_process.

	* stream.h (open_pipe, open_pipevp): Declarations updated.

	* txr.1: Documentation headings updated.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (open_pipev): Bugfix: program name is included
	as first element of argv.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implement open_pipev in terms of popen for Windows which
	does not have for or exec.  We could use CreateProcess and CreatePipe,
	et cetera, but it won't buy us anything because the whole point
	of this function is to improve the argument passing, and CreateProcess
	takes a single command line string, not too different from popen.

	* stream.c (pipev_close, make_pipev_stream): Surrounded with
	HAVE_FORK_STUFF ifdef.
	(pipe_close): Choice of close strategy conditional on HAVE_FORK_STUFF.
	(open_pipev): Conditionally defined in two ways now.
	(win_escape_arg, win_make_cmdline): New static functions.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: New test added for fork, pipe, exec and waitpid.
	Produces HAVE_FORK_STUFF in config.h.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (w_fopen, w_popen): Removing unnecessary casts of
	return values of ut8_dup_to.

	* match.c (complex_open): Likewise.

	* stream.c (w_opendir): Likewise.

2012-05-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implementing new pipe function to get around the limitation
	that popen accepts a complete command. We need something which
	accepts a program name, and a list of arguments, so that
	we don't have to assemble together a correctly quoted string.
	popen needs an alternative interface resembling execvp.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic registered, open-pipe-args.

	* stream.c (struct stdio_handle): New member, pid.
	(stdio_stream_print): Print the pid, if it is nonzero.
	(pipevp_close): New close function.
	(pipe_close): If h->pid is nonzero, it's a new-style pipe, which
	must be closed with pipev_close.
	(make_stdio_stream, make_pipe_stream): Initialize new stdio_handle
	member to zero.
	(make_pipevp_stream): New static function.
	(open_pipevp): New function.

	* stream.h (open_pipevp): Declared.

	* txr.1: open-pipe-args added to stub section heading.

2012-05-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_collect): Implemented semantics for repeat symbol.
	(dir_tables_init): Register dispatch for repeat to v_collect
	function.

	* parser.y (collect_repeat): New nonterminal symbol.
	(clause): Removed repeat_clause error case because that now clashes
	with the syntax in collect_clause.
	(collect_clause): Repeat syntax implemented, with help of
	collect_repeat.
	(out_clause): Error case for collect_clause removed due to
	syntactic clash.

	* txr.1: Added mention of @(collect :vars nil) and documented
	@(repeat) as the shorthand.

2012-05-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Do not capture the stderr of GNU Make in the
	configure step; send it to /dev/null.

	* txr.spec: Adding specfile for building RPMs.

2012-04-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (range_v_func, range_v_star_func): Restore the order of
	arguments to plus, so that the from object is on the left. This
	change was introduced in a commit on 2012-02-14, causing
	character ranges to break due to bug that addition did not
	commute for char + fixnum. Although the previous commit fixed
	the regression, it's still good to have the object on the
	left in case there are some future data types in case there
	is ever some form of addition which does not commute.

2012-04-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus): Fixed broken (+ fixnum char) case.

2012-04-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixes for configuring and building in a separate directory.

	* configure: MPI is now extracted and patched in the build directory,
	not in the source directory.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Refer to mpi headers relative to current
	directory, not $(top_srcdir).
	(repatch): Run MPI repatching steps in correct directory.
	(clean): Remove extracted MPI from build directory.

2012-04-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 65

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	(char_set_compile): Use char_set_addr_str to
	add spaces to set.
	(init_special_char_sets): Use char_set_addr_str to
	add spaces to set. Bugfix: word_cs, cword_cs wrongly initialized.
	(regex_init): Removed reference to regex_space_chars.

2012-04-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (regtoken): New nonterminal symbol.
	(regterm): REGTOKEN production factored out to regtoken.
	(regclass): Reverted prior commmit's changes.
	(regclassterm): Reverted prior commit, removing REGTOKEN
	production for character classes, and introduced a regtoken
	production. So now the keyword symbols are part of the
	character class abstract syntax.
	(regtoken): New production rule.

	* regex.c (regex_space_chars): Converted to internal linkage.
	(char_set_compile): Handle token keywords in character class
	abstract syntax.

	* regex.h (regex_space_chars): External declaration removed.

2012-04-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (REGTOKEN): New token type.
	(REGTERM): Translate REGTERM to keyword.
	(regclass): Restructured to handle inherited nodes as lists.
	(regclassterm): Produce $$ as list. Add handling for REGTOKEN
	occurring inside character class by expanding it. This might not
	be the best approach.
	(yybadtoken): Handle REGTOKEN in switch.

	* regex.c (struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set,
	struct displaced_char_set, struct large_char_set,

	remqual*, remove-if*, keep-if*.

	* lib.c (rem_lazy_func, rem_lazy_rec): New static functions.
	(remq_lazy, remql_lazy, remqual_lazy, remove_if_lazy,
	keep_if_lazy): New functions.

	* lib.h (remq_lazy, remql_lazy, remqual_lazy, remove_if_lazy,
	keep_if_lazy): Declared.

	* txr.1: New functions documented.

2012-04-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): find-if intrinsic registered.

	* lib.c (find): First and second arguments reversed.
	The item should be first.
	(find_if): New function.

	* lib.h (find): Declaration updated.
	(find_if): Declaration added.

	* txr.1: Stub section.

2012-04-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* HACKING: Added notes on generational garbage collection.

2012-04-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New functions remove-if and keep-if.

	* lib.c (remove_if, keep_if): New functions.

	* lib.h (remove_if, keep_if): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-04-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Restructuring configure script to be able to detect
	nonexistent options. Variable default values are established first,
	which simplifies the syntax. The scanning loop detects attempts
	to create configuration variables that do not exist.
	The var_given convention is folded into the parsing. (If var
	exists, and var_given exists, and the user specifies var,
	then var_given is set to y to indicate that the value came
	from the user.)

2012-04-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: multiple uses of @(next :args) seeing junk "args" string
	in argument list.  Fix is not to rely on the hack of using the  first
	element of the list of files to hold the name of the current file.

	* match.c (match_files_ctx): New member, curfile.
	(mf_all): Initialize curfile.
	(mf_args): Set curfile to "args".
	(mf_file_data): Initialize curfile.
	(v_skip, v_fuzz, v_gather, v_collect): Use c->curfile rater than
	first(c->files) in debug calls.
	(freeform_prepare, match_files): Pass c->curfile to ml_all constructor
	of match_line_ctx rather than rather than first(c->files).

2012-04-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Improve the regex Lisp syntax by allowing strings to specify
	character compounds. I.e. the syntax "foo" is equivalent to the
	cumbersome canonical form (compound #\f #\o #\o).

	* regex.c (nfa_compile_regex, dv_compile_regex): Use chrp function
	instead of typeof. Handle stringp case by forming a compound out of the
	characters and recursing. Check for some bad objects in the regex
	that would never come out of our regex parser but could occur
	in a "hand crafted" syntax tree.

2012-04-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Fix misleading comment example.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Adding patch to MPI to disable its Makefile so people don't try
	to work around TXR build problems by running make inside
	the MPI directory, which is wrong.

	Also fixing an incorrect use of ctype.h functions in
	MPI and one case of a superfluous warning.

	* mpi-patches/series: new patches added.

	* mpi-patches/disable-make: New file.

	* mpi-patches/fix-ctype-warnings: New file.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	More NetBSD porting.

	* Makefile (EXTRA_FLAGS): Handy new variable for additional
	ad-hoc CFLAGS. Needed by a new test in configure.

	* configure: Check for annoying warnings about char being used
	as an array subscript when calling the macros from <ctype.h>.
	If this occurs, suppress it by #undef-ing the macros.
	(lang_flags): Switching fromm _XOPEN_SOURCE to _XOPEN_SOURCE=2
	because this is needed on NetBSD to obtain declarations of
	popen and pclose.

	* stream.c (pipe_close): If we don't have the WIFCONTINUED macro,
	then define it to expand to zero. It's absent on NetBSD and they
	already seem to have a hack for this because there is a warning about
	the function not being defined, but then the program links anyway.
	Let's do it properly and not rely on their hack.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (INT_PTR_MAX_MP): New static variable.
	(in_int_ptr_range): New function.
	(arith_init): Initialize INT_PTR_MAX_MP.

	* arith.h (in_int_ptr_range): Declared.

	* lib.c (c_num): Allow bignums to be converted to a cnum, if
	they are in range, rather than allowing only fixnums.

	* rand.c (make_random_state): Now that we have such a function,
	initialize random seed using time value from time_sec_usec rather than
	from time and clock.  clock is bad for random seeding because it
	measures virtual time since the start of the process.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Switch from _POSIX_C_SOURCE=2 to _XOPEN_SOURCE.
	We will be relying on the gettimeofday function which only came
	into POSIX in 2001, but was in Unix long before then.

	* HACKING: Replace notes about -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE which are not true
	any more.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (conftest.ccver): New phony target.

	* configure: The test for non-working 128 bit integers in the gcc
	used by NetBSD 5.1 is not good enough to catch the bug.
	Adding a test which will assume that gcc 4.3.x and lesser
	does not have working 128 bit types.

2012-04-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Expose regex-compile and regexp as intrinsics.

	* lib.c (obj_init): Change spelling of nongreedy operator and put
	it into the user package so that it is available for use with
	regex-compile.

	* regex.c (match_regex, search_regex): Bugfix: optional start
	position argument argument not defaulting to zero.

	* txr.1: Documented regex-compile and regexp.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting regex-compile and regexp.

2012-04-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Port to NetBSD (5.1).

	* arith.c (bignum_dbl_ipt): Added missing #if HAVE_DOUBLE_INTPTR_T
	around function

	* configure: NetBSD's shell is too pathetic to expand "$@" properly
	when there are no positional arguments, so I applied the ${@+"$@"}
	trick.
	(make): New variable. GNU make might be known only as gmake,
	so we now detect the command for our own use within the configure
	script and also for giving the user advice on what command to use for
	building. Put in a fix so that the attempt to run $make --version
	does not bail the script under "set -e" if that command terminates
	unsuccessfully.
	The check for clashing names has been moved earlier, so that
	the renaming #define's appear early in config.h (so config.h itself
	can rely on the renames). The identifier longlong_t has been added
	to the potential clash list.  NetBSD exposes this identifier in spite
	of -D_POSIX_SOURCE=2, and it clashes with our longlong_t.
	The tests for integers wider than long long has been modified
	to actually compile a multiplication of two long-long-s into 
	the wider precision. On the NetBSD system, with gcc 4.1.3, I found
	that the __int128 type is there, but doesn't actually work;
	compilation of arith.c bails with an internal compiler error.
	We now get this internal error at configure time and avoid using
	the type.

2012-04-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/add-mp-hash (mp_hash): Fix incorrect
	code on platforms where mp_digit is smaller than long.
	This was left shifting a mp_digit by MP_DIGIT_BIT.
	It was found by compiling on NetBSD with a gcc 4.1.3
	which has a broken__int128_t, forcing us to use 32 bit
	mp_digit with a 64 bit mp_word.

2012-04-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (bignum): Previously static function now exposed as external.

	* arith.h (bignum): Declared.

	* configure: Added check for tm_gmtoff and tm_tmzone fields
	being present in struct tm.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic functions: time, time-usec.

	* lib.c (num): If the cnum is outside of the fixnum range, then
	construct a bignum.
	(time_sec, time_sec_usec): New functions.

	* lib.h (mut): Slight change to macro to eliminate compiler warning.
	(time_sec, time_sec_usec): Declared.

	* txr.1: Stub section for time and time-usec.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for time and time-usec.

2012-04-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Fixed accidental breakage.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c: Revert earlier change: config.h must be included before the
	<windows.h> section because that header is conditionally included
	based on one of the config constants.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixes to get configure ccname=g++ working on OSX Lion.

	* Makefile (conftest.syms): Use -n flag in nm so that the output
	is not alphabetically sorted, but numerically. We need this
	to get the symbols ordered by increasing offset.

	* configure (read_syms): New function. Factors out logic used
	in two places for reading the output of nm. On OSX Lion, it looks
	like we do not get symbol sizes but offsets only, when compiling
	with g++. The symbols are in an S section.  When compiling with
	gcc, we get a common C section with symbol sizes.
	So the hack is to use the deltas between offsets to get the sizes.
	The objects had to be re-ordered in decreasing rank so alignment
	doesn't create padding that will get counted as the size.
	Interleaved dummy objects of type char should also work.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Print done and terminate line after checking for
	clashing symbols.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Added new check for some clashing external names,
	which we can redefine out of the way in config.h.

	* lib.c: config.h was being included before <windows.h>.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented int-flo, flo-int, search-regex,
	match-regex and regsub.

2012-04-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Rounding out hash table functionality with lazy lists that
	can walk table content in different ways.

	* eval.c (op_dohash): Follow interface change of hash_next.
	(eval_init): hash-keys, hash-values, hash-pairs and hash-alist
	intrinsics introduced.

	* filter.c (trie_compress): Follow interface change of hash_next.

	* hash.c (hash_next): Silly interface which takes a pointer to
	the iterator has changed to just take the iterator. The function
	unambiguously returns nil when the iteration ends, so there
	is no need to set the iterator variable to nil.
	(maphash): Follows interface change of hash_next.
	(hash_keys_lazy, hash_values_lazy, hash_pairs_lazy, hash_alist_lazy):
	New static functions.
	(hash_keys, hash_values, hash_pairs, hash_alist): New functions.

	* hash.h (hash_next): Declaration updated.
	(hash_keys, hash_values, hash_pairs, hash_alist): Declared.

	* lib.c (make_half_lazy_cons): New way of constructing lazy cons,
	with the car field specified.  It simplifies situations when the
	previous cons computes the car of the next one. Why hadn't I thought of
	this before?

	* lib.h (make_half_lazy_cons): Declared.

	* txr.1: Doc stubs for new hash functions.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for new hash functions.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 64

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: @[...] syntax not marked as "contained" because it
	can freely occur, and is useful in @(output).

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* gc.c (FRESHQ_SIZE): Preprocessor symbol renamed to FRESHOBJ_VEC_SIZE.
	(freshobj, make_obj): Object and function definitions follow rename.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* gc.c (mark_obj, sweep_one, gc_is_reachable): Check for gen > 0 rather
	than gen == 0. This allows gen == -1 objects to be considered the
	same as gen == 0, and traversed.
	(gc_set, gc_mutated): When a gen 0 object is added to the checkobj
	array, set its generation to -1.  This prevents duplicates in
	the checkobj array. Also, it fixes a bug: an vector marked as
	mutated was not being traversed due to being in generation 1.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Code cleanup and tweaking.

	* gc.c (BACKPTR_VEC_SIZE): Preprocessor symbol renamed to
	CHECKOBJ_VEC_SIZE.
	(FULL_GC_INTERVAL): Increased to 40 since the modified
	algorithm now leaves less work for the full gc to do.
	(backptr, backptr_idx): Static variables renamed to
	checkobj and checkobj_idx.
	(mark): Follows rename of backptr and backptr_idx.
	(gc): Commented out handy printf added.
	(gc_set): Use in_malloc_range check to avoid adding to
	the check array pointers which are being stored in non-heap locations,
	since non-heap locations are already GC roots.
	(gc_mutated): Follows variable renaming.
	(gc_push): Just do the push using gc_set.

	* lib.c (malloc_low_bound, malloc_high_bound): New variables.
	(chk_malloc, chk_calloc, chk_realloc): Updated malloc_low_bound
	and malloc_high_bound.
	(in_malloc_range): New function.

	* lib.h (in_malloc_range): Declared.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	The mut macro should only be used for vectors or vector-like objects
	which hold direct references to other objects and must be used
	each time a mutation takes place.

	* eval.c (op_dohash): invocations of mut macro removed. 
	Comment rewritten.

	* lib.c (sort_list): Use set macro for mutating assignment.
	Do not invoke mut on sorted list; it won't work anyway, because
	it doesn't mean what the code wants it to mean: that the list will be
	fully traversed during gc marking.

2012-04-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bunch of fixes.

	* gc.c (gc_mutated): Return the value.

	* gc.h (gc_mutated): Declaration updated.

	* hash.c (remhash): Fix unsafe assignment to use set macro.

	* lib.c (sort): Fix wrong use of mut macro on the list
	before it is sorted rather than after.

	* lib.h (mut): Trivial version of macro updated to return argument.

	* unwind.c (uw_init): The toplevel environment's match_context
	should be gc_protected. Though this is probably not used,
	which is why it has not been a problem.

2012-04-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_grow, gethash_l, gethash, gethash_f): Replace
	useless use of *vecref_l() with vecref().

2012-04-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure (gen_gc): Default to off.
	Help section added for gen_gc variable.

	* gc.c (gc): Some missing CONFIG_GEN_GC added.

2012-04-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Code cleanup.

	* gc.c (backptr_oflow): Static variable removed.
	(freshq_head, freshq_tail, partial_gc_count): Static variables removed.
	(freshq): Array renamed to freshobj.
	(full): Variable renamed to full_gc.
	(freshobj_idx): New varaible.

	(make_obj): Add newly born objects to freshobj array rather than
	freshq. If freshobj array is full on entry to this function,
	trigger gc to empty it. make_obj no longer updates the free_tail;
	the gc routine takes care of restoring this invariant.
	(mark_obj): Follows rename of full_gc. Some code was not wrapped
	in #if CONFIG_GEN_GC.
	(mark, sweep_one): Follow rename of full_gc.
	(sweep): On entry, restore free_tail invariant in the empty
	free_list case. Code which processes freshq from tail to head
	replaced by simple array walk of freshobj. Code wrapped properly
	in #if CONFIG_GEN_GC.
	(gc): Logic for triggering full gc simplified.
	Check added for situations when a partial gc is called when
	the free list empties, and it doesn't liberate enough memory.
	This prevents the situation of partial gc being called over and over
	again by make_obj, squeezing less and less memory each time until
	finally it returns 0 objects, and more() is called.
	(gc_is_reachable): Follows rename of full_gc, and #if CONFIG_GEN_GC
	added.
	(gc_set, gc_mutated): Simplified. Check if the backptr array
	is full and trigger gc if so to flush it, then just add to the array.

2012-04-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Performance tweaking and fixes.

	* gc.c (BACKPTR_VEC_SIZE): Increase greatly, so that we don't
	trigger gc due to overflow of the backptr array. This is not likely
	to yield a lot of free objects except in a full GC.
	(FULL_GC_INTERVAL): From 10 to 20.
	(gc): Take a not of whether or not gc was entered with free_list
	being exhausted or not. Call more() only if the free_list was
	empty, and a full sweep was done.
	Reset partial_gc_count only when a full gc is triggered.

2012-04-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix failing test case tests/006/freeform-1.txr.

	* lib.c (lazy_str_force, lazy_str_force_upto): Use set macro
	when assigning lim. This won't cause a problem unless lim is
	in the bignum range, however.
	(acons_new, aconsq_new): When overwriting the cdr value of
	the existing entry, use set. This is the smoking gun;
	these functions are used for manipulating bindings.
	(sort): After sorting a list, we must mark it as having
	been mutated. If a list contains only mature conses or only
	fresh conses, there is no problem. But if it contains a mixture,
	then sorting could reverse their relationship, causing mature
	conses to backpoint to the fresh ones.
	(obj_init): Use set when installing the t symbol into the user package.

2012-04-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Generational GC showing signs of working. One test case in
	test suite fails.

	* gc.c (FRESHQ_SIZE): New preprocessor symbol.
	(backptr_oflow, freshq, freshq_head, freshq_tail): New static
	variables.
	(make_obj): Place newly allocated generation 0 object into
	freshq. If freshq becomes full, transfer oldest item into
	generation 1.
	(mark_obj): If doing only a partial gc, then do not mark
	objects which are not generation 0.
	(mark_mem_region): Valgrind support: cannot mark t.type field undefined
	because it is a bitfield. Just mark the first SIZEOF_PTR bytes
	of the object defined.
	(mark): Under partial gc, mark the table of back pointers.
	(sweep_one): New static function from the prior guts of sweep.
	Reachable objects now get promoted to generation 1.
	(sweep): Under partial gc, sweep just the freshq which identifies
	the generation 0 objects, rather than the entire linked list of all the
	heaps.
	(gc): Trigger full gc also if the backptr list has overflowed
	due to gc having been disabled.
	Under generational gc, reset the static variables afterward:
	clear the list of backpointers, and the freshq.
	(gc_is_reachable): Under partial gc, report any mature object
	as reachable.
	(gc_set, gc_mutated): Handle backptr array overflow situation
	when gc is disabled.
	(gc_push): Bugfix: it is the newly pushed cons cell that has to be
	marked as a root, not the value being pushed.

	* hash.c (sethash): Use set macro for storing value.

	* lib.h (set, mut, mpush): Fix wrong-way #if test for these macros.
	The trivial versions were being defined uner CONFIG_GEN_GC and vice
	versa!

2012-04-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_modplace): push replaced with mpush (mutating push).

	* gc.c (gc_push): New function.

	* gc.h (gc_push): Declared.

	* hash.c (pushhash): Use mpush.

	* lib.c (push): Reverted to unsafe operation. TODO comment replaced
	with warning.
	(lazy_flatten_scan): push occurence commented as safe.
	(lazy_stream_func): Unsafe push replaced with mpush.

	* lib.h (mpush): New macro.

2012-04-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Support a gen-gc configuration variable which
	causes CONFIG_GEN_GC to be defined as 1 in config.h.

	* eval.c (op_defvar, dwim_loc, op_modplace, transform_op): Handle
	mutating assignments via set macro.
	(op_dohash): Inform gc about mutated variables. TODO here.

	* filter.c (trie_add, trie_compress): Handle mutating assignments
	via set macro.

	* gc.c (BACKPTR_VEC_SIZE, FULL_GC_INTERVAL): New preprocessor symbols.
	(backptr, backptr_idx, partial_gc_count, full): New static variables.
	(make_obj): Initialize generation to zero.
	(gc): Added logic for deciding between full and partial gc.
	(gc_set, gc_mutated): New functions.

	* gc.h (gc_set, gc_mutated): Declared.

	* hash.c (hash_mark): Changed useless use of vecref_l to vecref.
	(gethash_f): Use set when assigning through *found since it
	is a possible mutation.

	* lib.c (car_l, cdr_l, vecref_l): Got rid of loc macro uses. Using the
	value properly is going to be the caller's responsibility.
	(push): push may be a mutation, so use set.
	(intern): Uset set to mutate a hash entry.
	(acons_new_l, aconsq_new_l): Use set when replacing *list.

	* lib.h (PTR_BIT): New preprocessor symbol.
	(obj_common): New macro for defining common object fields.
	type_t is split into two bitfields, half a pointer wide,
	allowing for generation to be represented.
	(struct any, struct cons, struct string, struct sym, struct package,
	struct func, struct vec, struct lazy_cons, struct cobj, struct env, 
	struct bignum, struct flonum): Use obj_common macro to defined
	common fields.
	(loc): Macro removed.
	(set, mut): Macros conditionally defined for real functionality.
	(list_collect, list_collect_nconc, list_collect_append): Replace
	mutating operations with set.

	* match.c (dest_set, v_cat, v_output, v_filter): Replace
	mutating operations with set.

	* stream.c (string_in_get_line, string_in_get_char,
	strlist_out_put_string, strlist_out_put_char): Replace mutating
	operations with set.

	* unwind.c (uw_register_subtype): Replace mutating operation with set.

2012-04-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (vec_set_length): Use set instead of assignment.
	(vecref_l): Use loc to lift address of cell.
	(replace_vec): Use macro mut to indicate the object is being
	mutated.

	* lib.h (mut): New macro.

2012-04-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Start of ground-work for ephemeral GC. We must add some abstraction
	to places where we potentially assign a reference to a younger object
	inside a field located in an older object (chronological
	backreference) and also where we take the address of an object
	field, making it possible that the user of the address will do so.

	This patch does not take care of vectors.

	No, this is not an April Fool's joke.

	* eval.c (env_fbind, env_vbind, env_replace_vbind, lookup_var,
	lookup_sym_lisp1): Use set macro instead of assignment.

	* hash.c (hash_grow, set_hash_userdata, hash_next): 
	Use set macro instead of assignment.

	* lib.c (rplaca, rplacd, string_extend, length_str, replace_str,
	rehome_sym, lazy_stream_func, lazy_str, lazy_str_force, 
	lazy_str_force_upto, obj_init): Use set macro instead of assignment.

	(car_l, cdr_l): Use loc instead of address-of operator.

	* lib.h (set, loc): New macros.

2012-03-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (last_equal_key, last_equal_hash): New static variables.
	(equal_hash): Caching optimization implemented.
	(eql_hash): Optimization extended to those objects that have
	equal semantics.
	(hash_process_weak): Clear the cached hash during gc.

2012-03-31  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	If one of the blocks which are subordinate to a @(trailer)
	happen to request a successful termination by invoking @(accept)
	the position must not advance into the trailer material.

	* match.c (v_trailer): Added an unwind protect which
	detects that an accept is taking place and adjusts the return value to
	restrict the input position at the point given to trailer.
	(accept_fail): Use uw_block_return_proto instead of uw_block_return
	and pass the symbol as the protocol identifier.

	* unwind.c (uw_current_exit_point): New function.

2012-03-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (num_str): Much more accurate test for deciding whether
	to treat the number as floating or integer. We can't just look
	for the presence of E, e or . because these coudl be part of
	trailing junk for instance "123XYZE." should convert
	to the integer 123, where "XYZE." is trailing junk.

	* txr.1: Documented int-str, flo-str and num-str.

2012-03-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (numeq): Fix misplaced parenthesis.

2012-03-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2012-03-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Do not use the #<lazy-string ..>
	notation for lazy strings that have been forced.

2012-03-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Compensate for differences in printf
	implementations with regard to printing floating point exponents.
	by deleting any plus sign and leading zeros after the 'e'.

	* tests/009/json.expected: Regenerated.

2012-03-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Filtering on lists and nested lists is hereby made to work.
	For instance given @(bind a ("a" "b" "c")) it is now possible
	to do @(filter :upcase a) whereby a promptly takes on the value
	("A" "B" "C").

	* filter.c (string_filter): Function renamed to string_tree_filter.
	(compound_filter): Follows rename.
	(filter_string): Function renamed to filter string tree.
	Can filter tree of strings, or possibly other objects,
	if the filter function allows.

	Just put them through the filter.

	* filter.h (filter_string): Declaration updated.

	* match.c (format_field, subst_vars, v_filter): Follow rename.

2012-03-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_output): Bugfix: we should flush the stream
	after each @(output) block. Otherwise if output blocks
	that go to standard output are interleaved with output blocks
	which pipe to some command which then goes to standard out,
	the output won't be in the proper order.

2012-03-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic num-str registered.

2012-03-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35989

	* match.c (syms_init): text_s must be in the system
	package because it's not a user-visible operator.

2012-03-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Performance improvement in the GC: keep at least one heap's worth
	of free space, so programs close to exhausting a heap do not
	waste cycles frequently calling the collector.

	* gc.c (more): Do not assert that free_list is null; this will
	not be the case any more.
	(make_obj): Comment added regarding why we the free_tail variable
	is fixed up.
	(sweep): Now returns a count of the objects that are free.
	(gc): If sweep reports that less than 75% of the objects are free
	then let us add another heap.

2012-03-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register match-str and match-str-tree
	intrinsics.

	* lib.c (match_str, match_str_tree): Default position to zero.

	* txr.1: Doc stubs created.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for match-str and match-str-tree.

2012-03-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: code like @(skip)@{var /partial/} where
	the regular expression does not match all the way to
	the end of the line was getting by the check for
	a complete match.

	* match.c (do_match_line): Loses the second parameter
	named completely. The check whether the line was matched
	completely is done higher up, in match_line_completely.
	This is needed because do_match_line has some early
	successful return cases which bypass the check.
	(match_line): Remove second paramter in call to do_match_line.
	(match_line_completely): Do the check here that the line
	was matched completely. Nothing can get by this.
	(v_freeform): Do notpass second nil argument to do_match_line.

2012-03-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (search_str): If start_num is nil, default it to zero.
	This is needed for this to work right as an optional argument.

2012-03-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 62

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

2012-03-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

	* txr.1: Describe floating-point constants.

2012-03-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (TXR_ARGS): Pass new file to tests/009/json.txr test.

	* tests/009/json.expected: Updated.

	* tests/009/json.txr: Updated source. Translates to a more native
	representation with vectors and hash tables. Numbers go to
	floating point instead of remaining as strings.

	* tests/009/pass1.json: New file: a test case from json.org.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (expo): New function.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for exp.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (transform_op): use integerp instead of numberp.
	Not all numbers are integers now, and that situation
	requires an integer.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Bugfix: was not allowing e-notation floats
	with no decimal point like 1E1.

	* stream.c: (vformat): Keep track of whether or not precision was
	given in precision_p local variable.
	When printing #<bad-float> pass a precision of 0
	to vformat_str, not precision, since precision does not apply.
	In ~f and ~e, if the precision was not given, default
	it to 3.
	Restructured float printing in ~a and ~s. It now just uses sprintf's %g
	with a precision. If user does not specify precision, it defaults
	to DBL_DIG to print the number with reasonable accuracy.
	A .0 is added if it sprintf produces an integer, and the conversion
	is ~s rather than ~a.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix sqrt confusion. There must be a separate isqrt
	for the integer square root.

	* arith.c (sqroot_fixnum): Renamed back to isqrt_fixnum.
	(sqroot): Rewritten to handle only floating-point square root.
	(isqrt): New function, based on previous sqroot,
	handles only integers.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic, isqrt.

	* lib.h (isqrt): New declaration.

	* txr.1: Doc stubs.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for isqrt.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (floorf, ceili, sine, cosi, atang, loga): New functions.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic functions registered:
	floor, ceil, sin, cons, atan, log.

	* lib.h (floorf, ceili, sine, cosi, atang, loga): Declared.

	* txr.1: Doc stub section for new functions.

	* txr.vim: Highighting added.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (int_flo): If sprintf produces something
	that doesn't begin with a digit, it's most likely NaN or Inf.
	We can turn that into an exception.

	* stream.c (vformat): If sprintf produces a non-number,
	turn it into the printed representation #<bad-float>.

2012-03-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (to_float): New static function.
	(divi): Uses to_float.
	(zerop, gt, lt, ge, le, expt): Floating support.
	(isqrt_fixnum): Static function renamed to sqroot_fixnum.
	(isqrt): Renamed to sqroot. Floating support.
	(evenp, oddp, exptmod, gcd): Work with integers, not floats.

	* eval.c (eval_init): intrinsic registration of sqrt follows rename of
	isqrt to sqroot.

	* lib.h (isqrt): Declaration replaced.

2012-03-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (divi): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): divi registered as / intrinsic.

	* lib.h (divi): Declared.

2012-03-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Doc stubs for new functions floatp, integerp,
	float-str, int-flo and flo-int.

	* txr.vim: Highlighting for new functions.

2012-03-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile: link in -lm, which is needed now on some systems.

	* arith.c (plus, minus): Eliminated some unnecessary (double) casts.
	(abso, mul): Floating support.

2012-03-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (neg): Floating-point support.

	* parser.l: FLO and FLODOT cases had to be reordered because
	the lex trailing context counts as part of the match length,
	causing 3.0 to be matched as three characters with 0 as
	the trailing context. The cases are split up to eliminate
	a flex warning.

	* stream.c (vformat): Support bignum in floating point
	conversion. Bugfixes: floating point conversion was
	accessing obj->fl.n instead of using n.
	Changed some if/else ladders to switches.

2012-03-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus): Minor code simplification.
	(minus): Floating point support.

	* mpi-patches/mpi-to-double (mp_to_double): Re-apply lost
	bugfix: index incremented instead of decremented.
	Didn't refresh patch last time, then did a make distclean.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Regression fix: 1..3 scans incorrectly into 1. .3 tokens.

	* parser.l (SGN, EXP, DIG): New regex definitions.
	(FLO): Do not recognize numbers of the form 123.
	Decimal point must be followed either by exponent, or digits
	(which may then be followed by an exponent).
	(FLODOT): New token type, recognizes 123.
	(grammar): Recognize FLODOT as a floating point number,
	only if it not trailed by another dot, and
	recognize FLO unconditionally.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus): Completed implementation of bignum-float
	and float-bignum cases.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Use larger num_buf buffer so we don't
	overrun. IEEE double floats can go to e+-308.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (flo_int): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): flo-int registered as intrinsic.

	(mp_to_double): New MPI function.

	* mpi-patches/mpi-to-double: New file.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus): Optimization: use num_fast when
	result is in the fixnum range.
	Implemented FLNUM cases, except for adding a FLNUM
	to BGNUM.
	(minus, mul): Use num_fast when the cnum value is in the fixnum range.
	(int_flo): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register int-flo intrinsic.

	* lib.c (c_flo): New function.

	* lib.h (TYPE_SHIFT, TYPE_PAIR): New macros, carried over
	from the lazy strings branch.
	(c_flo, int_flo): Declared.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l (FLO): Adjusted syntax of floating point numbers
	to allow leading or trailing decimal.

2012-03-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): num_buf increased to 256 because we
	are now printing floating point numbers into it, letting
	the C library handle precision which can generate many digits.
	We cap the precision at at 128. New format specifiers ~e
	and ~f implemented, which loosely correspond to those of printf.
	The ~s and ~a directives handle floats similarly to ~g in
	printf, except that they ensure that a decimal point is printed
	for the non-exponential notation.

2012-03-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure (uintptr): New variable. Indicates whether unsigned
	version of intptr_t is available and should be generated in config.h
	as uintptr_t.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic functions floatp,
	integerp, flo-str.

	* gc.c (finalize): Handle FLNUM case. Rearranged

	(mark): Handle FLNUM case.

	* hash.c (hash_double): New function.
	(equal_hash): Handle FLNUM via hash_double.
	(eql_hash): Likewise.

	* lib.c: <math.h> is included.

	(code2type, equal): Handle FLNUM case in switch.
	(integerp): New function; does the same thing
	as integerp before.
	(numberp): Returns t for floats.
	(flo, floatp, flo_str): New functions.
	(obj_init): Initialize new float_s variable.
	(obj_print, obj_pprint): Handle FLNUM case in switch.
	Printing does not work yet; needs work in stream.c.

	(struct flonum): New struct type.
	(union obj): New member, fl.
	(float_s, flo, floatp, integerp, flo_str): Declared.

	Scans to a NUMBER token.
	Corrected uses of yylval.num to yylval.val.

	* parser.y (%union): Removed num member from yystype.

2012-03-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (debug): Breakpointing now takes into account 
	the module file name, not only the line number. Breakpoints work on
	source locations rather than line numbers.  Boy, this was easy. 
	Keep the breakpoint list free of duplicates. Issue a message
	if a nonexistent breakpoint is asked to be deleted.

2012-03-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): url_decode has two parameters now,
	so we make the second one optional.

	* filter.c (topercent_k, frompercent_k): New keyword
	variables.
	(url_encode, url_decode): Take a second parameter, space_plus.
	This determines whether or not to apply the rule that
	a space encodes as a + character.

	and :frompercent filters.  Fix the previous registrations of :tourl and
	:fromurl using currying.

	* filter.h (urlencode, urldecode): Declarations updated.
	(topercent_k, frompercent_k): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-03-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Changing type function to not blow up on nil, which makes a lot of code
	simpler. A pseudo type code is introduced called NIL with value 0.

	* lib.h (enum type): New enumeration value, NIL.
	(type): Function accepts object nil and maps it to code NIL.

	* eval.c (dwim_loc, op_dwim): test for nil obj and goto hack is gone,
	just handle NIL in the switch.

	literal.

2012-03-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (do_chain): More useful behavior. The first
	function, if any, is treated as variadic. Subsequent
	functions are monadic.
	(chain, chainv): Turn do_chain into variadic.

2012-03-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2012-03-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Support quasiquoting over vectors also, and a bugfix for hash
	quasiquoting.  We cannot use the same symbol for the
	literal form from the parser, and for the expanded form,
	because this creates a confusion when there are multiple
	nestings of quasiquote expansion.

	* eval.c (vector_lit_s, vector_list_s, hash_lit_s): New symbol
	variables.
	(hash_construct_s): Relocated here from hash.c.
	(expand_qquote): Part of bugfix: look for hash_lit_s
	instead of has_construct_s. Translate to a hash_construct_s
	form which is no longer recognizes as a hash literal.
	Implementing recognition of a quasiquote vector literal,
	handled similarly.
	(eval_init): Initialize vector_lit_s, vector_list_s,
	hash_list_s and hash_lit_s.
	Use vector_list_s when registering vector_list function.

	* eval.h (vector_lit_s, vector_list_s, hash_lit_s,
	hash_constuct_s): Declared.

	* hash.c (hash_construct_s): Variable removed
	and relocated into eval.c.
	(hash_init): Initialization of hash_construct_s removed.

	* hash.h (hash_construct_s): Declaration removed.

	* parser.y: (vector): Action updated to generate
	a (vec-lit ...) form if the object contains unquotes,
	otherwise generate a vector object.
	(hash): Generate hash-lit form, not a
	hash-construct form.

2012-03-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Allow quasi-quoting over hash table literals,
	to express dynamic hash table construction

	* eval.c (expand_qquote): Recognize hash-construct
	forms: expand the hash arguments and pairs separately,
	then rewrite to a new hash-construct form.
	(eval-init): hash-construct intrinsic function added.

	* hash.c (hash_construct_s): New symbol variable.
	(hash_construct): New function.
	(hash_init): Initialize hash_construct_s.

	* hash.h (hash_construct_s, hash_construct): Declared.

	* parser.y (hash): Rule rewritten to emit either a literal
	hash table object, or a hash-construct form, based on
	whether quasiquote unquotes occur within the syntax.
	(hash_from_notation): Function removed.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Change: @(block) requires @(end) from now on.
	Blocks no longer extend to the end of the surrounding
	scope.

	* match.c (v_block): Rewrite for new syntax.

	* parser.l (BLOCK): New token type handled.

	* parser.y (BLOCK): New token.
	(block_clause): New nonterminal grammar symbol.
	(clause): Collateral fix: replaced a bunch of
	list(X, nao) forms with cons(X, nil).
	Introduced block_clause as a constituent of clause.

	* txr.1: Revamped documentation of block, and
	wrote about using blocks for reducing nested
	skips and reducing backtracking in general.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l (ID_END): Bugfix: ID_END was defined incorrectly
	for the current way in which an identifier token is recognized.
	As a result @(collect-ing) was being interpreted as @(collect -ing).
	It should be the complement of NSCHR.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* regex.c (regsub): the replacement argument
	can now be a function of one argument which maps
	the original piece of text matched by the regex
	to a replacement text.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (stdio_put_string, stdio_put_char, stdio_put_byte): Do not
	consider data sent to std_error to be output for the purposes of
	the output_produced flag. Otherwise the program behavior changes
	in -v mode; it will not print bindings.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implementing URL filtering.

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic functions: url-encode, url-decode.

	* filter.c (tourl_k, fromurl_k): New keyword variables.
	(is_url_reserved, digit_value): New static functions.
	(url_encode, url_decode): New functions.
	(filter_init): Intialize new keyword variables and register
	new :tourl and :fromurl filters.

	* filter.h (tourl_k, fromurl_k, url_encode, url_decode): Declared.

	* txr.1: Updated.

	* txr.vim: Likewise.

2012-03-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (string_out_byte_flush): Bugfix. Do not loop inside this
	function. This must not flush out more than one character out of this
	small buffer, except when we are flushing out the last data.
	The correct operation is predicated on the assumption that 
	a complete character can be pulled out. That's why we move the
	buffer to the front after consuming it, and do not automatically
	flush until there are four bytes.
	(string_out_put_string): We loop the call to string_out_byte_flush
	here because when a request comes in to write a Unicode character,
	we flush all the bytes, even if the tail of those bytes forms
	an incomplete sequence that turns into U+DCxx codes.
	(get_string_from_stream): Use the same loop termination test
	as in string_out_put_string, for consistency. In that function
	it is needed to prevent infinite looping in the case when
	the string_out_put_string is being called from string_out_byte_flush
	and is thus re-entering it.

	* tests/010/strstream.expected: New file.

	* tests/010/strstream.txr: New file.

2012-03-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implementing put_byte for string output stream.
	This does the Right Thing with a mixture of bytes and characters.
	Incomplete byte sequences.

	* stream.c (struct strm_ops): Changing byte argument of put_byte
	to int, since the put_byte API function can just pass down that
	value after validating it.
	(stdio_handle): Use available typedef.
	(stdio_put_byte): Follow interface change in strm_ops.
	Do not validate the range of a byte; the put_byte higher
	level function does that now.
	(struct string_output): New members: ud, byte_buf, head, tail.
	(string_out_byte_callback, string_out_byte_flush): New static
	functions.
	(string_out_put_string): Flush any UTF-8 bytes in the byte buffer
	before putting the string.
	(string_out_put_byte): New static function, implementation for
	put_byte on string output streams.
	(string_out_ops): string_out_put_byte wired in.
	(make_string_output_stream): Initialize new members of
	of struct string_output.
	(get_string_from_stream): Flush any UTF-8 bytes in the byte buffer
	before retrieving the string.
	(put_byte): Validate that the byte is in range. Pass byte
	as C int down to the put_byte virtual.

2012-03-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Plugging memory leak.

	* stream.c (byte_in_stream_destroy): New function.
	(byte_in_ops): Use new function instead of noop stub.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Update. Adding remq, remql, remqual, regsub, *stddebug*

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35718. Workaround good enough to get some code working.

	* eval.c (cons_find): New function.
	(expand_op): Use cons_find rather than tree_find to look for
	rest_gensym.

	* regex.c (regsub): Rearranged arguments so that the string
	is last. This is better for partial evaluaton via the op
	operator.

	* regex.h (regsub): Updated declaration.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New intrinsic function, regsub.

	* regex.c (regsub): New function.

	* regex.h (regsub): Declared.

	* txr.1: Doc stub added.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (split_str): Separator can be a regex now.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 60

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

	* txr.vim: Handle : symbol properly.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus): Showstopper bug: plus(bignum, fixnum)
	broken for fixnum <= 0. Bad pointer passed to MPI.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/add-mp-hash (mp_hash): Fixed use of uninitialized
	variable on platforms where the MP digit is smaller than a long integer.
	(Not anything TXR is known to run on). Changed algorithm to take the
	first and last digit and add them together, rather than just taking the
	last digit. The last digit will be zeros for numbers that contain 2 as a
	factor with a large enough multiplicity.

	* mpi-patches/add-mpi-toradix-with-case: Refreshed.

	* mpi-patches/bit-search-optimizations: Likewise.

	* mpi-patches/faster-square-root: Likewise.

	* mpi-patches/fix-bad-shifts: Likewise.

	* mpi-patches/fix-mult-bug: Likewise.

2012-03-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_defun): Bugfix: documentation says that defun supports
	the same parameter list as lambda, and that is the intent. But
	this was broken, since op_defun was expecting the parameter list
	to be a proper list containing only bindable symbols, ruling out
	the use of the consing dot for rest parameter as well as the colon
	keyword symbol for optional parmeters.

2012-03-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Expose remq, remql and remqual.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-03-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (sub_str): Removed second check for lazy string that
	can't ever come out true.

	* match.c (search_form, h_var, h_coll, h_parallel, h_fun): Handle
	position t emanating from match_line, indicating match to end of line.
	(h_skip): When skipping to the end of line (empty spec), just
	return t as the position rather than the end of the line. This avoids
	calculating the length of the line, which forces a lazy string.
	(do_match_line): Near the beginning of the loop, if the position is t,
	then substitute the length of the line.
	(freeform_prepare): Return the freeform line limit value.
	(v_freeform): Check for t coming out of match line and do the
	conversion back to the trailing list in that case, but only if
	the freeform was limited by number of lines.

2012-03-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (search_form): search_form works with relative positions now,
	but match_line returns absolute, and so needs to be offset by -c->base.
	(h_trailer, h_fun): Bugfix: return the absolute position, rather than
	relative c->pos. The return value of these functions becomes the return
	value of do_match_line, so the semantics has to agree.

2012-03-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (sem_error, file_err): Bugfix: pull text formatted source
	location using source_loc_str rather than raw object using source_loc.

2012-03-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_load): Fixed broken functionality. Failing to evaluate
	directives following the load and consume input properly.
	Check for errors during the parse and throw an exception.

2012-03-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixing two instances of unintentional O(n*n) behavior and poor memory use
	that occur in horizontal matching of basic text patterns.

	* lib.c (match_str, match_str_tree): New functions.

	* lib.h (match_str, match_str_tree): Declared.

	* match.c (do_match_line): Use match_str_tree and match_str when matching
	strings and string lists, respectively, rather than stupidly calling
	search functions and then asserting that the match was found at the
	starting position.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (do_match_line): Function takes new argument, "completely".
	The check for completely matching a line is now done within
	do_match_line.
	(match_line): Pass nil to do_match_line, specifying that a prefix
	match is okay.
	(match_line_completely): New interface to do_match_line, which
	requests a match to the end of the line.
	(v_freeform): Pass nil to do_match_line: freeform needs 
	incomplete match semantics.
	(match_files): Use match_line_completely instead of match_line.
	By doing it this way, we do not need to compute the length of
	the original line and compare it to the absolute position.
	This saves time and memory since computing the length of a lazy
	string forces it.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (consume_prefix): This memory optimization should only
	be done for lazy strings, otherwise it just causes unnecessary
	memory use by duplicating the line, and inefficiency via
	thanks to allocator churn.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (numberp): Fix bad type check: null pointer dereference when
	object is nil.

	* match.c (do_match_line): Bugfix for incorrect treatment of long
	lines. Must return the absolute position from the start of the original
	line (plus(c->pos, c->base)), rather than just c->pos, which only
	measures from the start of a line that may have been chopped by
	consume_prefix.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: rlcp function was incorrect for new way of storing
	line number info.

	* parser.h (rlset): Declared.
	(rlcp): Use rlset.

	* parser.y (rlset): New function.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (help, debug): New g command for tweaking log level.

2012-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c: Missing d command implemented.
	Condense the output to 8 times the screen width, for more context.
	Condense the output in vertical mode (when the entire input line
	is shown) not only character mode.

	* lib.c (remq, remql, remqual): New functions.

	* lib.h (remq, remql, remqual): Declared.

	* lib.c (sub_list, replace_list, lazy_sub_str, sub_str, replace_str,
	sub_vec, replace_vec): Regression: replace incorrect zerop(to)
	test with to == zero, because to is not necessarily a number.

2012-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Recognize backslash-newline break in regexes.

2012-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Substantially revised for better lexical accuracy
	and highlighting of errors.

2012-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (extract): Check for negative value of opt_nobindings,
	which forces the printing.

	* txr.c (help): Under -b, mention that printing the  word false is
	suppressed also. Added documentation for -B.
	(main): Implemented -B option.

	* txr.1: Documented -B option and added clarifying text under -b
	option explaining the conditions under which bindings are printed.

2012-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fix the issue properly, once and for all, of how to determine
	that output has taken place and suppress the printing of bindings.

	* debug.c (debug): std_output replaced with std_debug.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registered new *stddebug* variable.

	* stream.c (std_debug): New variable.
	(stdio_put_string): Check that stream is other than
	std_debug, to determine that output has taken place.

	* stream.h (std_debug): Declared.

	* txr.1: Added *stddebug* to documentation stub heading.

2012-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixing long-time (pre-GIT) bug. The object (nil) was stupidly used to
	represent empty optional output clauses, distinguishing them from
	missing clauses. This creates an ambiguity, so that an @(output)
	block which puts out a single empty line is treated as empty.
	Present but empty clauses are now represented by t.

	* match.c (do_output_line): Check for t and bail.
	(do_output): Check for t instead of (nil) and bail.

	* parser.y (o_elems_opt2): Nonterminal deleted.
	(out_clauses_opt): Empty case generates nil.
	(req_parts_opt): o_elems_opt2 replaced by o_elems_opt.
	(repeat_rep_helper): Function now keeps track of which
	clauses were specified. For those that were specified, but
	empty, it substitutes t.

	* tests/008/empty-clauses.expected: New file.

	* tests/008/empty-clauses.txr: New file.

2012-02-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35625

	* parser.l (BSCHR, BSYM, BTOK): New lexical definitions.
	(BRACED): New state.
	(grammar): Refactored so that braced variables are now handled
	in the BRACED state, allowing for lexical differences between
	braced variables and Lisp. This allows us to have
	the /regex/ syntax in braces, but /regex/ is just a symbol
	in the Lisp. The new #/ token is recognized and returned
	as HASH_SLASH. All rules reformatted to a more easily
	maintainble convention.

	* parser.y (HASH_SLASH): New token.
	(modifiers, lisp_regex): New nonterminals.
	(var): Grammar changed to use modifiers nonterminal instead of exprs.
	(var_op): Rule moved closer to var.
	(expr): Produces lisp_regex rather than regex.
	(yybadtoken): Handle HASH_SLASH in the switch statement.
	Bugfix: HASH_BACKSLASH was not handled.

	* txr.1: Documented #/regex/ syntax.

2012-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (del_s): New symbol variable.
	(eval_error): nostatic added to suppress a g++ warning.
	(dwim_loc): Takes new value as the original unevaluated form so
	it can control evaluation. Support for del operator added.
	(op_modplace): Bugfixes: new value form was being unconditionally
	evaluated and out of order w.r.t. other forms. Now there is
	left to right order. The form is evaluated later, since for most
	operators it is on the right, with the exception of push.
	dwim places can now optionally control the evaluation of newform.
	del operator supported in gethash case as a special case.
	error case added for del: if it's not handled in gethash or
	dwim_loc, it is an error.
	(eval_init): del_s initialized, and del operator added to table.

	* txr.vim: syntax highlighting for del.

	* txr.1: Documented del.

2012-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (init): Hash bugfix: added missing call to hash_init.
	Previously this function did nothing, but now it interns
	some important symbols.

2012-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (remhash): Rewrote buggy function.
	It was decrementing the hash count without checking that
	something was deleted from the chain. The deletion was done
	incorrectly, without regard for the kind of comparison fucntion
	used by the hash table.

2012-02-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Intrinsic bindings for sub, ref, refset

	* match.c (extract_vars): If a brace var is actually an
	expression, then recurse into the expression to find
	variables. This allows us to do things like @{`@x`} inside
	a @(repeat) or @(rep).

2012-02-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Allow braced output variables to actually be arbitrary substitutions.

	* eval.c (subst_vars): Treat the variable as an arbitrary
	expression rather than just a symbol.

	* match.c (subst_vars): Likewise.

2012-02-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (dwim_loc): 2012-02-13 fix didn't do it. 
	Here is a simpler way. We can let nil be treated as a list with a
	simple goto. This solves all cases.

2012-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Register match-fun.

	* match.c (v_do): Store match context.

2012-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_catch): Treat the nil exception object as an empty
	list, and not the atom nil.

	* match.c (v_try): Do not transform an atomic exception x into
	the list ((t . x)). Just to (x). This (t . x) representation is
	a vestige of from the time when the exception consisted of the
	old-style return values from txeval.

2012-02-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	TXR Lisp gets exception handling.

	* eval.c (op_catch, expand_catch_clause,
	expand_catch): New static functions.
	(expand): Handle catch operator.
	(eval_init): Added catch operator to op_table,
	and registered new functions throw, throwf and error.

	stub section for throw, throwf and error.

	* txr.vim: Updated.

	* unwind.c (uw_throwfv, uw_errorfv): New functions.

	* unwind.h (uw_throwfv, uw_errorfv): Declared.

2012-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rangev_func, rangev, range_star_v_func,
	range_star_v): Regression: handle the case where the range is
	open-ended (to is nil).

2012-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rangev): If a descending range is specified,
	but the step is omitted, the step should be negative one
	rather than one.
	(range_star_v_func, range_star_v): New static functions.
	(eval_init): New function, range*, registered.

	* txr.1: Stub section for range is also for range*.

	* txr.vim: Recognize range* function.

2012-02-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rangev_func): Improved termination test. The sequence
	not only if it achieves the endpoint, but if it crosses it.

2012-02-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (dwim_loc): Allow assignment to the dwim place when it
	evaluates to nil, by building a form targetting the place,
	and recursing into op_modplace.  Also, optimization: don't use eval
	on a form built from the operator; just go to op_modplace directly.

2012-02-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 57

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2012-02-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (subst_vars): Handle lone symbols (not wrapped
	in sys::var form) as variables. This allows interpretation of metanums
	in quasiliterals, because these are replaced by variables in the
	op expander.

	* parser.l: Recognize METANUM in QSILIT state.

	* parser.y (quasi_item): METANUM parsed in quasiliteral.

	* txr.vim: Metanums highlighted properly.

2012-02-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (dwim_loc, op_dwim): Bugfix: hash indexing requiring

	the screen.
	(debug_init): Try to get terminal width, from the COLUMNS variable.

2012-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (lazy_flatten): Bugfix: function was assuming that
	the input is a list, and not handling the case
	atom -> (atom) like its non-lazy counterpart.
	This broke @(next :list expr).

2012-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (obj_print): Print control characters in string and
	character literals as hex escapes, followed by semicolon if
	necessary. Don't use iswprint function since it is locale-specific
	and concludes that non-ASCII characters are unprintable.
	Changed print syntax for lazy strings.
	(obj_pprint): Changed print syntax for lazy strings.

	* parser.l: Bugfix in hex/octal character constant.
	num_esc(yytext) was called rather than num_esc(yytext+1).

	* parser.y (chrlit): Bugfix: missing case for hex and octal
	constants which are given by a LITCHAR token.

	* stream.c (vformat): Bugfix: strings were being printed as if using ~a
	even under ~s.

2012-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11486

	* match.c (h_coll): Call consume_prefix in the loop.

2012-02-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	when displaying character position.
	(do_match_line): Pass base position to debug_check.
	(match_files): Pass nil as base to debug_check.

2012-02-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11486: continuation. Now able to @(skip) through
	a large file horizontally under @(freeform) in constant memory.
	Position reporting is incorrect.

	* match.c (match_line_ctx): New member, base.
	(ml_all): Initialize new member to zero.
	(consume_prefix): New static function.
	(do_match_line): New static function, contains implementation of
	match_line. Calls consume_prefix.
	(match_line): Becomes a wrapper for do_match_line.
	(search_form, h_skip): Call consume_prefix.
	(freeform_prepare): New function. External to avoid inlining.
	(v_freeform): Uses do_match_line, to down context by reference,
	and also refactored to avoid spurious retention of c->data.

	* unwind.c (uw_push-block, uw_push_env, uw_push_debug,
	uw_push_catch): Zero out the structure, otherwise the unused
	fields can cause spurious retention.

2012-02-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11486: preparatory refactoring.

	* match.c (h_match_func): Changed to one-argument form.
	(LOG_MISMATCH, LOG_MATCH): References to structure members
	changed from member selection . to ->.
	(h_text, h_var, h_skip, h_coll, h_parallel, h_trailer,
	h_fun, hv_trampoline, h_define, h_do): Changed to one-argument form
	that takes a pointer to the context.
	(match_line): Local pointer named c used so that the
	LOG_MISMATCH and LOG_MATCH macros can be used.

2012-02-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (lazy_sub_str): New static function.
	(sub_str): Bugfix: handle t values of from from and to, and negative
	indices, just like sub_vec.  Special handling for lazy strings
	introduced.  If to is the value t, then the a lazy string can be
	produced.

2012-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* genman.txr: Updated.

	* txr.vim: Fixed mistakes in a few regex character classes,
	causing upper case letters not to be recognized as part
	of a variable name, and character hex constant.

2012-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 56

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2012-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Allow semicolon terminator on hex and octal
	escapes in a regex. Removed o escape character from octal
	constants in strings and quasiliterals: no such thing is documented.
	Octal constants can be semicolon-terminated like hex ones.

	* txr.1: Documented semicolons after octal constants in
	string literals and after hex and octal constants in regexes.

2012-02-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc, utf8_decode): Some cascaded if tests converted
	to a switch on the upper nybble value. This also fixes an unfortunate
	bug. The test for the two byte case was written as 
	ch >= 0xc2 && ch <= 0xE0. That should have been ch < 0xE0.
	Versions of TXR up to 55 have been incorrectly decoding some UTF-8.

2012-02-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc): Bugfix: incorrect condition in character
	range check (less than minimum *and* U+DCxx, rather than *or*).
	Also, we must check for out of range characters. UTF-8 sequences
	beginning with F4 can code beyond 0x10FFFF.
	(utf8_decode): Check for characters beyond 0x10FFFF.

2012-02-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (rest_s, op_s): New variables.
	(do_eval_args): Allow calls specified by improper lists

	that turns into addition arguments to be applied.
	(transform_op, expand_op): New static functions.
	(expand): Call expand_op.
	(eval_init): Initialize rest_s and op_s. Use rest_s
	to register rest function.

	* lib.c (gensym): New function based on gensymv.
	(gensymv): Now calls gensym.

	* lib.h (gensym): Declared.

	* parser.l: Parse @ followed by digits as a new kind of token,
	METANUM.

	* parser.y (METANUM): New token.
	(meta_expr, exprs): Missing rlcp's added.
	(expr): METANUM variant introduced.
	(yybadtoken): Handle METANUM.

	* txr.1: Documented one-symbol argument list of lambda.
	Documented op. Closed some unbalanced parentheses.

	* txr.vim: Highlight op.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc, utf8_decode): Use upper case for hex constants.
	If bytes decode to U+DCxx, treat this sequence as invalid. This
	way we can't be fooled by an attacker into accepting some U+DCxx which
	on output we will then convert to byte xx.
	(utf8_to_uc): Use upper case for hex constants.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_to_uc, utf8_encode): Do not encode surrogate code
	points (U+DC00 to U+DCFF) as multi-byte UTF8 sequences.  We use
	that range for invalid bytes on input, so on output the best thing
	to do is to reproduce the original bytes. E.g the code U+DCA0
	will produce the byte A0.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: UTF-8 handling clarified.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc, utf8_decode): Impose a minium value on the
	decoded character based on which UTF-8 case it is from.  This rejects
	overlong forms.

	* utf8.h (struct utf8_decoder): New member, wch_min.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Document that TXR accepts UTF-8 overlong forms.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Move error match before other cases and simplify.
	Comment are colorized properly again.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	This test case would have caught the prior regression.

	* Makefile (TXR_ARGS): Defined for new test case.

	* tests/010/align-columns.dat: New file.

	* tests/010/align-columns.expected: New file.

	* tests/010/align-columns.txr: New file.

2012-02-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (format_field): Regression. Was not handling modifiers
	which are compound expression (e.g. computed field widths).
	This was broken by the first commit of 2012-01-26.

2012-02-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (lookup_sym_lisp1): New function.

	(dwim_loc, op_dwim): Use eval_lisp1 and eval_args_lisp1 instead
	of eval and eval_args.

	* parser.y (meta_expr): Bugfix: expand the whole dwim expression,
	rather than its arguments, which are not an expression.

	* txr.1: Updated with notes that dwim really does Lisp-1 style
	evaluation.

2012-01-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: More color categories. More accurate matching of @ elements.

2012-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Support hex and octal escapes in string and quasiliterals,
	as the documentation says. Also support an optional trailing ;
	delimiter in hex escapes.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Properly show @[...] inside quasiliteral.

2012-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (dwim_loc, op_dwim): Relax the requirement on hash
	indexing arguments. The default value can be omitted,
	defaulting to nil.

2012-01-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_begin): Missing type check added, otherwise
	passing in an object that is not a hash results in corruption
	or crashing behavior.

	* lib.c (class_check): Improved to a one-step check with a clear
	message.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Allow a string to be the replacement (split into a list of
	characters).
	(replace_str): Bugfix in assignment from vector; wrong index
	used over source vector.
	(split_str): If the splitting set is empty, just split the
	string into characters instead of getting into an infinite loop.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (listref, listref_l): Negative indices must have semantics
	consistent with vecref and ranges.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (cat_str): Throw error if one of the list elements
	is not a character or string instead of silently returning nil.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: More discussion of ranges.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (format_field): Removed useless use of cat_str (no longer
	needed because str is already a string). The purpose was to reduce
	character to strings.
	(subst_vars): Some of the new logic in format_field must be replicated
	in the case when format_field is not called because the variable
	has no modifiers. Lists must be converted to a space-separated string.
	Bugfix here: occurence of pat and modifiers is not mutually exclusive.

2012-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (dwim_loc, dwim_op): Eliminated redundant re-evaluation

	* eval.c (dwim_loc): Handles full responsibility for assigning
	to list and array ranges.
	(op_modplace): Pass extra arguments to dwim_loc so it can
	do the job for ranges. If dwim_loc returns 0, it means
	that it did everything.
	(op_dwim): Support list and array ranges.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-01-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (zerop): Misspelling in error message.

	* lib.c (sub_list, replace_list, sub_vec, replace_vec):
	Allow the value t to specify one element past the end, so that t t
	refers to zero-length sequence just past the end of the array or list.
	Also, fixed out of bounds memmoves in replace_vec.

	in op_table.

	* eval.h (dwim_s): Declared.

	* lib.c (chr_str, chr_str_set): Allow negative indices to index
	backwards from end of string.
	(vecref, vecref_l): Allow negative indices to index from
	rear of array.

	variables (up_p_a_pairs) if they are present.

	* debug.h (debug_begin): Renamed to debug_frame.

	* eval.c (eval): Wrap debug_begin/debug_end around function dispatch,

	that lacks debug support.

2012-01-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (last_command): Initialize to empty string rather
	than nil, otherwise hitting enter tries to repeat the nil command.
	(show_bindings): New function. Prints all levels of bindings.
	(debug): Flip the corresponding print flags after printing the current
	form or data, so they are not printed for every prompt.
	On EOF from standard input, substitute the q command.
	If enter is hit and there is no last command, just re-print the prompt.
	The v command uses show_bindings to dump the environment.

	* eval.c (eval): When calling debug_check, pass the env objects, rather
	than the bindings it contains.

2012-01-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (car_l, cdr_l): Bugfix: do not call the lazy cons
	force function if it is already nil, and set it to nil afterward.

2012-01-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Make lazy_appendv function
	available as append*.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2012-01-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Before releasing 53, there is this.

	* eval.c (c_var_mark): Bugfix: we cannot use cptr_get from
	within the garbage collector because of its type check.
	Bugfix: synchronize the shadow binding with the variable's
	current contents so we don't hang on to a stale object.

2012-01-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Fix regression introduced in
	2011-12-29 commit. We can't use mod_s, because the module
	which sets up that variable is not yet initialized.

2012-01-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Make C globals in TXR Lisp properly assignable, so that for instance
	assigning *stdout*, it really overwrites the underlying C variable.

	* eval.c (lookup_var): Handle new kind of toplevel binding.
	If the hash value is a cptr, it points to a val storage location.
	(lookup_val_l): New function.

	* parser.y (repeat_rep_helper): Bugfix. Circular lists
	were being created here when clauses of the same kind appear multiple
	times. The problem is that append2 no longer copies the second list,
	which the code was relying on it to do.

2011-12-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Useless sentence under reduce-left and reduce-right removed.
	Missing Description headings added.

	to (foo) rather than (sys:expr foo).

2011-12-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/shrink-mpi-int (mpi_int): Fixed terrible bug in this
	patch, resulting in an insufficient bit field width for representing
	the allocation size of the MPI integer on 32 bit platforms.

2011-12-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* rand.c (make_state): Use ANSI C syntax for prototyped function of no
	arguments. This snuck through due to working with a C++ compiler.
	(random): Fixed unused variable warning that happens on 32-bit-pointer
	platforms.

	(lazy_flatten): New function.
			
	* lib.h (lazy_flatten): Declared.

	* match.c (v_next): Use lazy_flatten instead of flatten for
	processing a :list source. This means that @(next :list ...)
	can be used to process infinite lazy lists.

	* txr.1: Documented lazy-flatten.

2011-12-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* rand.c (rand32): Moved.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35010

	* match.c (extract_bindings): Make sure there are no duplicate
	variables among the extracted bindings. This is needed because
	of the other changes.
	(do_output_line, do_output): In handling the rep/repeat directives,
	append the original bindings to the extracted set bindings for the
	variables which just occur in the clause, so that Lisp code can see all
	of the variables.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): If width is specified for ~s or ~a, and
	the object is not a string or number, then print it to a string
	and treat it as a string, adjusting it within the field.
	Also, do not simply abort on an unknown format directive
	but throw a proper exception.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Left-adjusted field is now  specified
	using < rather than '-'. The +, space and leading 0 are
	specified on the precision, not the width.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* rand.c (random): Fix for 64 bit fixnums: stick two random numbers
	together. Otherwise for fixnum moduli, we get only a 32 bit number no
	matter what the modulus is.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (vformat): Combine ~a and ~s cases, so numbers and
	strings are printed the same way under ~s and ~a.  The only difference
	is printing other kinds of objects.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35026

	* stream.c (format_num): New argument: sign character.
	Rewrote to handle precision, width, zero padding and
	leading sign similarly to printf.
	(vformat): New syntax accepted: a space or + before
	the width specifies that a positive sign is to be
	explicitly written as a space or + character.
	Pass one more argument to vormat_num calls.
	Bugfix: go back to vf_init state after processing ~~.

2011-12-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35136 and cleanup.

	* arith.c (plus, minus, mul, gt, ge, lt, le, exptmod, gcd): Remove
	trailing abort; we already marked uw_throwf as noreturn. This hack
	should not be needed in functions where the last statement is a throw.
	(trunc, expt): Repeated error case handled in one place. Temp variable
	used to avoid two calls to mp_clear. Call to abort removed.
	(mod): Repeated error handed in one place. Plugged memory leak
	by moving throw past mp_clear calls. Call to abort removed.
	(isqrt): Repeated error case handed in one place.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Fixed to char literal syntax.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/bit-search-optimizations (s_highest_bit):
	It will take days to completely wipe the egg off my face.
	I forgot to fix this code for unsigned integers before
	pasting it into MPI.

	* arith.c (normalize): Linkage changed to extern.

	* arith.h (normalize): Declared.

	* txr.1: Doc stubs for PRNG functionality.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* rand.c: Added comment about source of algorithm.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* rand.c (random): Bugfix: not building up sufficiently large bignums.
	Work properly when mp_digit is smaller than 32 bits.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (OBJS): new object file, rand.o.

	* eval.c: Includes rand.h header.
	(eval_init): New variable and functions from rand module registered.

	* lib.c: Includes rand.h header.
	(init): Call rand_init.

	* rand.c: New file.

	* rand.h: New file.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35139

	Better fix.

	* parser.y (YYEOF): If YYEOF is not defined, define it as zero.
	(yybadtoken): Undo previous changes: do not test for zero.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35139

	* parser.y (yybadtoken): The current token (yychar) is 0 on byacc
	rather than YYEOF or YYEMPTY, so we have to handle that.

2011-12-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (distclean): use rm -rf on mpi directory.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Test case for bug #35137

	* tests/007/except-2.expected: New file.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New function registered.

	* lib.c (cat_vec): New function.

	* lib.h (cat_vec): Declared.

	* txr.1: Documentation stub.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #35137

	* unwind.c (uw_unwind_to_exit_point): When jumping to a catch frame,
	do not mark it invisible.

	* unwind.h (uw_catch): Flip the matches to nil so that this catch
	frame can no longer be identified as an unwind point by uw_throw,
	and thus will not be re-entered for the purposes of handling
	an exception. It remains visible for the purposes of running the
	clean up code.
	(uw_unwind): Prior to executing cleanup forms, flip the visibility
	to 0. This means that the frame will no longer be re-entered
	for any reason.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Streamlining exception handling macros a little bit.

	* eval.c (op_unwind_protect): Use uw_simple_catch_begin,
	and remove the uw_catch (exsym, exvals) clause. Put
	explicit braces around the unwind code even though it
	is only one statement.

	* match.c (do_txeval): Got rid of empty uw_unwind clause.
	This is not needed any longer.
	(v_try): Got rid of explicit uw_do_unwind calls. 

	* unwind.h (uw_simple_catch_begin): New macro.
	(uw_do_unwind): Macro removed.
	(uw_catch): Added goto uw_unwind_label at the front.
	This way if the previous clause falls through,
	control goes to the unwind logic.
	(uw_unwind): Got rid of initial break. Previous
	clause should fall through to unwind logic,
	whether it is the main clause, or one of the catches.
	(uw_catch_end): Default case aborts, because
	we don't expect this.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Critical regression. Hash lookup was crashing on some platforms
	due to negative hashing values being reduced modulo table size
	to a negative array index.

	* hash.c (equal_hash, eql_hash): Ensure
	that value returned is in the range [0,NUM_MAX].
	(hash_obj): Unused function removed.
	(cobj_hash_op): Use hashing similar to eql hash for
	other kinds of references.
	(hash_eql, hash_equal): Removed bogus % NUM_MAX reduction.

	* hash.h (hash_obj): Declaration removed.

2011-12-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2011-12-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (bindings_helper): Fix format arguments.
	(eval_init): Registered new functions: symbol-function,
	func-get-form, func-get-env, functionp, interp-fun-p.

	* lib.c (nappend2, getplist_f, improper_plist_to_alist):
	tail variable renamed to avoid clash in macro.
	(func_get_form, func_get_env, interp_fun_p): New functions.

	* lib.h (func_get_form, func_get_env, interp_fun_p): Declared.
	(list_collect): Fix macro not to throw error, but handle the case.

	* match.c (vars_to_bindings, extract_bindings): tail variable
	renamed to avoid clash in macro.

	* txr.1: Documentation stubs.

2011-12-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (equal_hash): Eliminating displacement from character
	hashes. Simplifying some code.
	(eql_hash): Handle fixnums, characters and literals specially,
	rather than hashing all value types the same way. The shift
	applicable for object pointers causes adjacent integers to clash.

2011-12-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_vars): Bugfix: use expand_forms rather than
	expand on a list of forms.

2011-12-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: iskeyword updated.

2011-12-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (appendv): bugfix: wrong way test.
	(vector_list): Wrong zero used, resulting in vector(nil) being called.

2011-12-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): not added as synonym for null.

	* lib.c (copy_list): Use list_collect_append rather than
	list_collect_terminate.
	(append2, appendv): Simplified using new list_collect_append.
	(nappend2): Simplified using new list_collect_nconc.

	* lib.h (list_collect): Added check for accidental usage
	of list_collect after list_append, since PTAIL has different
	semantics.
	(list_collect_nconc, list_collect_append):  Semantics fixed so that
	append collecting works more like the Common Lisp append function,
	allowing trailing atoms or a lone atom. The meaning of PTAIL is
	changed, however.  Now PTAIL actually tracks the head of the most
	recently appended segment. Each append operation has to first
	traverse the previously added piece to get to the end.

	(list_collect_terminate): Macro removed.

	* match.c (v_gather): Removed useless use of list_collect_terminate.

	* parser.y: Some headers added that are needed by list_collect.

	* txr.1: Documented append, list, atom, null, not, consp, make-lazy-cons,
	lcons-fun, listp, proper-listp, length-list,  mapcar, mappend, and apply.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	@# comments are becoming obsolescent. @# comments
	can now be used. Within nested forms,
	Lisp-compatible ; comments are suported.

	* parser.l: Support @# and ; comments.

	* txr.1: Documentation updated.

	* txr.vim: Updated.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (car, cdr): Set the lazy cons function to nil
	after calling it.
	(rplacd): Do not set the lazy cons function to nil
	in.

	* txr.1: Documented a bunch of functions.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): Removed registration for vec_get_fil.
	Renamed vec_set_fill to vec-set-length.

	* hash.c (equal_hash): vec_fill to vec_length name change.
	(hash_grow, make_hash): No need to call vec_set_length.

	* lib.c (equal, vecref, vec_push, length_vec, list_vector,
	obj_print, obj_pprint): vec_fill to vec_length name change.
	(vector): Argument now represents actual length, not just allocated
	size.
	(vec_get_fill): Function removed; did exactly the same thing
	as length_vec.
	(vec_set_fill): Function renamed to vec_set_length.
	(vector_list): Allocate a 0 length vector initially.

	* lib.h (enum vecindex): member changes name from vec_fill
	to vec_length.
	(vector): Parameter name changed.
	(vec_set_fill): Redeclared.
	(vec_get_fill): Declaration removed.

	* txr.1: Doc stubs updated.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (car, cdr): Semantics fix for lazy conses.
	Ignore the return value of the lazy cons function: do not
	return nil if the function returns nil.
	This useless behavior was a source of inconvenience in lazy
	cons programming, requiring the lazy function to return
	non-nil in addition to installing the car and cdr fields.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (abso): broken for fixnums.

2011-12-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2011-12-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (repatch): New phony target.
	(distclean): Remove mpi directory.

2011-12-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Patch to shrink mpi-int to three words on 32 bit platforms,
	so that obj_t stays four pointers wide.

	* mpi-patches/series: New patch added.

	* mpi-patches/shrink-mpi-int: New file.

2011-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/bit-search-optimizations (s_highest_bit): Added static
	storage class specifier.

	* mpi-patches/fix-mult-bug (s_mp_sqr): More braindamage found in MPI.
	This function performs additions and multiplication mp_digit,
	expecting a mp_word precision result without casting. This function
	is needed for exponentiation.

2011-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Git rid of some some loops in MPI where it is searching for
	the highest bit, replacing them with an adapation of the
	bit searching function used in arith.c.

	* mpi-patches/series: Patch added.

	* mpi-patches/bit-search-optimizations: New file.

2011-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (expt): New function.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Registering new intrinsic functions,
	reduce-left, reduce-right and expt.

	* lib.c (minusv): Return one instead of num(1).
	(exptv, reduce_right): New functions.

	* lib.h (expt, exptv, reduce_right): Declared.

	* txr.1: Blank sections for new functions.

2011-12-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/fix-mult-bug: One more flaw discovered in
	s_mp_mul_d and added to patch. This one caused malloc corruption and
	crashes, because the incorrect arithmetic causes the function
	to think that the multiplication will not be needing another
	digit, but then there is a carry out which does spill into
	a new digit.

	* mpi-patches/series: Arg! Somehow the patch fix-bad-shift
	went missing from the series file, even though the patch
	itself is in the GIT repository.

2011-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 047

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	to numberp to fixnump.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (plus, mul): Plugged mpi_int memory leaks.
	(trunc): Plugged memory leaks. Straightened out semantics
	with negative modulus. (Residue comes out negative).

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c (trunc): Error messages prefixed with trunc:.
	(mod): New function, reimplementation of removed mod from lib.c.

	* lib.c (mod): Function removed.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bignum division implemented. More portability bugs found in MPI:
	code like 1 << n, where n exceeds the width of the type int.

	* arith.c (trunc): New function, reimplementation of removed
	trunc from lib.c.

	* lib.c (trunc): Removed.

	* mpi-patches/fix-bad-shifts: New file.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	(plus, minus): Bugfix: must not pass signed values to mp_add_d and
	mp_sub_d functions.
	(mul): Must not pass signed value to mp_mul_d.  Also, fixed type check
	on wrong argument in the (TAG_PTR, TAG_NUM) case.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Removing this crutch; it's not that useful.

	* arith.txr: File removed.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c: Regenerated.

	* arith.txr (normalize): Bugfix: was not turning +/- NUM_MAX bignums
	into fixnums.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c: Regenerated.

	* arith.txr (highest_bit): Missing #else added, fixing
	SIZEOF_PTR == 4 case.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c: Regenerated.

	* arith.txr (highest_bit): Oops, half the logic for
	the 64 bit case was missing due to to a cut and paste mistake.

2011-12-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c: Regenerated.

	(mul): New functions, rewrite of mul from lib.c.

	* lib.c (mul): Function removed.

	* mpi-patches/add-mp-set-intptr (mp_set_intptr): Revised patch.
	Local variable v should be int_ptr_t not unsigned long.
	Also, the mp_set interface doesn't set the sign; it's an unsigned
	interface. We must do that ourselves.

	* mpi-patches/fix-mult-bug: The main multiplication function is
	also broken in the same way, requiring the cast.

	* mpi-patches/mpi-set-double-intptr: Fixed use of wrong type for
	local variable v.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/mpi-set-mpi-word: Bugfix and refresh.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: add to config.h the type double_intptr_t, which
	is twice the size of intptr_t. It may not be available, so
	there is a HAVE_ macro to detect it.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New functions added as intrinsics.

	* hash.c (hash_eql, hash_equal): New external functions.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* mpi-patches/add-mp-hash: Rewrote mp_hash to only hash enough
	low-order bit material from the bignum to fill an unsigned long.
	We don't need to walk the entire bignum. If the low order
	digit of the bignum is at least as large as an unsigned long,
	we just take that as the hash, otherwise we take enough of the
	digits to fill an unsigned long. For negative numbers, we just
	invert the bits of the hash.

	* mpi-patches/add-mpi-toradix-with-case: Refreshed.

	* mpi-patches/fix-mult-bug: Refreshed.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (mulv): Recognize cases to eliminate a wasteful mul call
	with an initial element of 1.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (plusv): Recognize cases to eliminate a wasteful plus call
	with an initial element of zero.

2011-12-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* arith.c: File is now generated using TXR.
	(NOOP): New macro.

	(minus, neg): Function moved here from lib.c and rewritten
	for bignum support.

	* lib.c (minus, neg): Functions removed.

	* arith.txr: New file.

2011-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Fix patching without quilt.

2011-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Build and pass test suite on Cygwin.

	* configure (longlong, ulonglong, superlong, usuperlong): Initialize
	these variables so that if the detection tests fail, the script
	does not access unbound variables.
	Avoid adding junk like .bss.* into config.h.

	* mpi-patches/config-types: Fixed wrong use of nonexistent
	SIZEOF_LONG_T.

2011-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	(Applies to previous commit.)

	* mpi-patches/config-types: Added missing definitions
	of MP_DIGIT_SIZE in two cases.

2011-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bignum support, here we go!

	Bignums, based on Michael Fromberger's MPI library, are integrated
	into the input syntax, stream output, equality testing, the garbage
	collector, and hashing.
	
	The plus operation handles transitions between fixnums and bignums.
	Other operations are still fixnum only.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Add mpi directory to include file search.
	(OBJS): Include new arith.o module and all of MPI_OBJS.
	(MPI_OBJS, MPI_OBJS_BASE): New variables.

	* configure (mpi_version, have_quilt, have_patch): New variables.
	Script detects whether patch and quilt are available. Unpacks
	mpi library, applies patches. Detects 128 bit integer type.
	Records more information in config.h about the sizes of types.

	* dep.mk: Updated.

	* depend.txr: Make work with paths that have directory components.

	* eval.c (eval_init): Rename of nump to fixnump.

	* gc.c (finalize, mark_obj): Handle BGNUM case.

	* hash.c: (hash_c_str): Changed to return unsigned long
	instead of long.
	(equal_hash): Handle BGNUM case.
	(eql_hash): Handle bignums with equal-hash, but other
	objects as eq.

	* lib.c (num_s): Variable renamed to fixnum_s.
	(bignum_s): New symbol variable.
	(code2type): Follow rename of num_s. Handle BGNUM case.
	(typeof): Follow rename of num_s.
	(eql): Handle bignums using equal, and other types using eq.
	(equal): Handle BGNUM case.
	(chk_calloc): New function.
	(c_num): Wording change in error message: is not a fixnum.
	(nump): Renamed to fixnump.
	(bignump): New function.
	(plus): Function removed, reimplemented in arith.c.
	(int_str): Handle integers which are too large for wcstol
	using bignum conversion. Base 0 is no longer passed to
	wcstol but converted to 10 because the special semantics
	for 0 would be inconsistent for bignums.
	(obj_init): Follow rename of num_s. Initialize bignum_s.
	(obj_print, obj_pprint): Handle BGNUM.
	(init): Call arith_init.

	* lib.h: Includes "mpi.h", as an exception to the project rule against
	headers including headers.
	(enum type): New enumeration member, BGNUM.
	(struct bignum): New struct type.
	(union obj): New member bn.
	(mp): New inline function.
	(num_s): Redeclared as fixnum_s.

	* match.c (h_var, h_line, h_skip, h_coll, h_fun, format_field, v_skip,
	v_freeform, v_collect, v_match_files): Follow nump to fixnump rename.

	* parser.l (NUM): New token type. Split up the parsing of identifiers
	and numbers once again. But since every number is also lexically also
	lexically an identifier, we put the action first. The action for
	making numbers handles bignums. It produces object numbers, not
	C numbers (change in yystype union).

	* parser.y (%union): num changes type from cnum to val.

	* stream.c (vformat): Handle bignums in numeric conversions.

	* arith.c: New file.

2011-12-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	C++ maintenance.

	* eval.c (and_s, or_s): Redundant variables removed.

	* match.h (do_s): extern storage class specifier added.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_defun): Transform a function body by inserting
	a named block around it, thereby imitating a Common Lisp feature.
	(op_for): Establish an anonymous block around the loop body,
	test form and increment forms.

	* txr.1: Documented named block in defun. Documented for and for *.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Updated with all operators and functions.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: flip operator documented. Bad syntax for pop fixed.
	Blank section for list-vector function added.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_modplace): If the operator is push, then reverse
	the arguments. We want (push item list) for compatibility with CL.
	(expand): Bugfix: some of the cases were constructing new
	forms using unexpanded pieces from the original form.
	Added separate case for push, which handles the reversed arguments.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (debug): Fix regression: repeat last command by hitting
	Enter stopped working.  This was broken by recent bugfixes in the
	string splitting functions, which introduced a semantics change.

	* eval.c (flip_s, vecref_s): New symbol variables.
	(op_modplace): New places (vecref ...) and (flip ...). Bugfix: dec
	operator was incrementing.
	(expand_place): Handle vecref and flip. Bugfix: pop has no
	third argument and so is now handled by the same case as flip.
	Bugfix: if a modify form has no third argument, then do not
	resynthesize it with a nil third argument.
	(eval_init): Initialize new symbol variables.
	Register new flip operator. Register new list_vectory function
	as intrinsic.

	* lib.c (rplacd): When modifying the cdr field of a lazy cons,
	then lapse the lazy function to nil! This is needed by user-defined
	lazy conses, and it makes sense to do it this way rather than
	put in some explicit interface.
	(list_vector): New function.

	* lib.h (list_vector): Declared.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (lookup_var, lookup_fun): Reversing assoc arguments.
	(eval_init): New intrinsics.

	arguments to assoc adn assq.

	* lib.h (assoc, assq): Declarations updated.

	* match.c (dest_set, dest_bind, h_var, h_coll, h_parallel, h_fun,
	subst_vars, do_txeval, v_next, v_parallel, v_gather, v_collect,
	v_flatten, v_cat, v_output, v_filter, f_fun, match_funcall):
	Reversing arguments to assoc.

	* unwind.c (uw_get_func, uw_exception_subtype_p, uw_register_subtype):
	Reversing arguments to assoc.

	* txr.1: Blank sections created for new functions.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (chr_toupper, chr_tolower): New functions.

	* lib.h (chr_toupper, chr_tolower): New functions declared.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: In the CHRLIT state, return a nonblank character as an
	IDENT token. This allows for character literals like #\$.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): New character functions registered.

	* lib.c (c_num): Generalized to convert characters to numbers also.
	This allows functions like gt and lt to work with characters.
	(chr_isalnum, chr_isalpha, chr_isascii, chr_iscntrl, chr_isdigit,
	chr_isgraph, chr_islower, chr_isprint, chr_ispunct, chr_isspace,
	chr_isupper, chr_isxdigit): New functions added.

	* lib.h: (chr_isalnum, chr_isalpha, chr_isascii, chr_iscntrl,
	* chr_isdigit, chr_isgraph, chr_islower, chr_isprint, chr_ispunct,
	* chr_isspace, chr_isupper, chr_isxdigit): New functions declared.
	(c_true): New macro.

2011-12-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (progn_s): New symbol variable.
	(op_progn): New static function.
	(eval_init): Initialize new variable, register progn operator.

	* txr.1: progn documented.

2011-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* stream.c (find_char): New function.
	(string_in_get_line): Following up TODO. Fixed broken
	function. Now get_line on a string stream properly returns characters
	up to and not including the next newlne character, and also consumes
	the newline character. Other cases are handled properly, also:
	the stream being at EOF already, or at the last line not being
	newline-terminated.

2011-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_unwind_protect): Fixed uninitialized variable
	warning.
	(eval_init): New functions registered: typeof and vector functions,
	as well as length_list.

	* lib.c (length): Function renamed to length_list, because it is
	list specific.
	(length_vec, size_vec, vector_list): New functions.
	(length): New function, generic over lists, vectors and strings.

	* lib.h (length_list, length_vec, size_vec, vector_list): Declared. 

	* match.c (h_var, h_fun, robust_length, v_deffilter, v_fun): Use
	length_list instead of length.

	* parser.l: Introduced # token.

	* parser.y (vector): New nonterminal.
	(expr): vector is a kind of expr.
	(chrlist): Bugfix: single-character syntax was not working;
	for instance #\x to denote the charcter x.
	(lit_char_helper): Use length_list instead of length.

	* stream.c (string_in_get_line): Bugfix: this was using
	the wrong length function: length was being applied to a string.
	The genericity of length makes that correct now, but changing
	to length_str anyway.

	* txr.1: Blank sections created for functions. Vector syntax
	documented.

2011-12-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Forgot to treat octal number in the processing
	of conftest.syms. Removed useless eval.

2011-12-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	eq_f, eql_f and equal_f. Added identity to function table.

	* lib.h (eql_f): Missing declaration added.

	* txr.1: Documented cond, and, if, or, defun, inc, dec,
	set, push and pop.

2011-12-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (force_regular_quotes): Function removed.
	(list): Prior commit reversed.

	* txr.1: Prior commit reversed.

	* RELNOTES: No semantics clarification in quasiquote; bugfixes only.

2011-12-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_qquote_error, op_unquote_error): New static functions.
	(expand_qquote): Bugfix: missing case added to handle directly quoted
	quasiquote.

	op_table.

	* parser.y (force_regular_quotes): New function.
	(list): Quotes within unquotes and splices are regular.

	and turned into external function.
	(lazy_stream_func, lazy_stream_cons): Follow rename
	of make_lazycons.

	* lib.h (rplaca, rplacd, make_lazy_cons, lcons_fun): 
	Declared.

	* txr.1: Stub sections created.

2011-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (uw_protect_s, return_s, return_from_s): New symbol
	variables.
	(op_unwind_protect, op_block, op_return, op_return_from): 
	New static functions.
	(expand): Removed case for call, if, and, and or. These operators
	evaluate all their arguments, so the code walker can treat them
	as a function calls.
	Added case for block and return-from.
	(eval_init): New symbols interned.  New operator functions
	registered in op_table.

	* txr.1: Blank sections added.

2011-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (split_str, split_str_set): Bugfix: access beyond the end of
	the input string.

2011-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): String and character functions
	exposed as intrinsics.

2011-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Added stub sections for new functions.

2011-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c: Symbol related intrinsic functions and variables made
	available:

	* lib.h (sym_name): Dangling declaration removed.

2011-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (list): unquote and splice actions look inside the
	argument form. If an unquote or splice are applied to a quoted
	form, its quote becomes a regular quote.
	This behavior is necessary to make ,',form work in nested
	quotes, otherwise the ' is a quasiquote which captures
	the comma in ,form, reducing ,',form to ,form.

	* txr.1: Documented this special behavior.

2011-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (expand_qquote): Bugfix: removed bogus recognition
	and processing of regular quote form. This broke nested
	backquote processing, and quasiquote forms containing
	non-quasi-quotes like like '(a 'b ,c).

2011-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 044

	symbol syntax.

2011-12-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (int_str): Return nil rather than 0 if no digits are extracted
	at all.

2011-12-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (h_skip, h_coll, v_skip, v_collect): Evaluate the arguments.
	(do_txeval): Optimization: short-circuit out if the expression is nil,

	* match.c (v_skip): Bugfix: Nov 12 commit caused regression:
	skip min/max arguments not working!

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-12-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Dropping the silly cons return value from txeval.
	Two interfaces are provided to the function. One throws
	on unbound variable, the other which evaluates them to the
	symbol noval_s (used in exception handling).

	* match.c (do_txeval): New static function.
	(txeval): Functionality moved to do_txeval.
	(txeval_allow_ub): New static function.
	(vars_to_bindings, h_fun, v_freeform, v_next, v_merge, v_bind, v_set,
	v_cat, v_output, v_deffilter, v_fun): No need to
	use cdr to get the value from txeval.
	(v_throw): Use txeval_ub_allowed, since unbound variables
	are allowed in throw.

	nil. No need to use cdr.

2011-12-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (eval_form): Function renamed to txeval so its is
	not confused with the Lisp evaluation functions.
	(vars_to_bindings, h_fun, v_freeform, v_next, v_merge, v_bind, v_set,
	v_cat, v_output, v_throw, v_deffilter, v_fun): Updated.

2011-11-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.h (or2): Restore macro version of or2, because we need
	the sequencing! Making it an inline function broke the tests.
	But we can't have multiple evaluation either, so it's going to use
	a temporary lexical variable.
	(uses_or2): Macro which declares the lexical variable needed by or2.

	* debug.c (debug): add uses_or2.

	* eval.c (eval_intrinsic, op_modplace): Likewise.

	break_obj and not yet reached, then call breakpt.
	(deheap): New debugging function for viewing regions of the heaps.

	* lib.c (breakpt): New function.

	* lib.h (breakpt): Declared.

2011-11-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (hash_process_weak): Fix regression caused by a mistake
	in the the 2010-01-26 commit, prior to release 033. When processing a
	table with weak values, this function was mistakenly testing the keys
	rather than values for for reachability. I noticed this when a test
	case that should run in constant memory showed unwarranted accumulation
	of memory.

2011-11-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (op_modplace): Bugfix: conflation of new value and
	increment value. Separate new value and increment value, and check

	(eval_init): dohash_s initialized and entered into op_table.

2011-11-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* eval.c (eval_init): hashp and maphash functions registered.

	Support assignment to (car ...) and (cdr ...).

	* eval.c (car_s, cdr_s): New symbol variables.
	(op_modplace): Cases for car and cdr added.
	(expand_place): Likewise. Calls abort should the
	cases fall through rather than returning 42.

	source location info. Bugfix: expansion for do added.
	(eval_init): car_s and cdr_s initialized and used
	in place of previous intern calls.

	* parser.y (elem): Removed wrong logic for expanding the
	do form. It was expanding only the first argument.

	(op_let): Refactored to allow for let* form. Code for setting
	up bindings moved into bindings helper, shared by for loop.
	(op_for, expand_vars): New static functions.
	(expand): Bugfix: let case was neglecting to walk the var
	initialization forms. This is done via expand_vars now.
	let_star_s added to this case to handle let* and let at
	the same time. New case added for for and for*.
	(eval_init): let_star_s, for_s, and for_star_s initialized,
	and entered into op_table.

2011-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	(eval_init): Registered numerous stream functions and the
	three standard streams.

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Modified to return a value.

	* lib.c (getplist_f): New function.

	* lib.h (getplist_f): Declared.

	* match.c (v_collect, h_coll): Use getplist_f to distinguish
	the case that :vars is explicitly specified as (). In this
	case, no bindings escape from the collect.

	* tests/008/soundex.txr: This test case broke due to using
	:vars () and yet counting on the variable to exist.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_funcall): Set source location info for
	generated function call.

2011-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (texts, elem): Fixed incorrect use of rl rather
	than rlcp.  Added forgotten rlcp on result of optimize_text.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 043

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.c (remove_hash_bang_line): Recognize multiple
	syntax possibilities. A hash bang could be buried in a (text ...)
	compound, or it could just be a string (thanks to the text form
	optimization).

2011-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Optimization: if all the elements of (text ...) are
	strings, then replace the (text ...) by the catenation
	of those strings.

	* parser.y (optimize_text): New function.
	(elem): Use optimize_text.

2011-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (plus, minus): Fixed wrong assertion which would incorrectly
	fire for inputs that do not overflow.

	* match.c (search_form): Fixed incorrect loop test which could
	lead to nonterminating behavior.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Semantics change. If a variable is followed by a mixture
	of text and regular expressions, that whole mixture is
	considered to follow the variable and used for matching.

	The earlier semantics change whereby a single unescaped
	space denotes the regular expression / +/ broke the
	simple case   @a word.   It caused the @a to be followed
	not by the text " word"  but by just the regular expression
	element.

	With this change @a word means that a is followed by 
	the regex / +/ and "word".

	* match.c (text_s): New symbol variable.
	(h_text): New function.
	(syms_init): Initialize new symbol variable.
	(dir_tables_init): Hook h_text into horizontal directives table.

	* match.h (text_s): Declared.

	* parser.y (text, texts): New nonterminals.
	(elem): TEXT, SPACE and regex are now handled under texts
	grammar production. All texts are run together and produce
	an item which looks like (text items ...).

	* txr.1, RELNOTES: Updated.

	* txr.c (remove_hash_bang_line): Updated to find #! buried
	in (text ...) syntax.

2011-11-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Fix environ test case for C++.

2011-11-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (search_form): Bugfix: we must search to one character
	position after the end of the line, otherwise we can never match
	@(eol).
	(h_eol): Bugfix: do not return t, but the line length.

	* txr.1: Warn users about @var@(bind ...) pitfall.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

2011-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Relaxing :vars in collect/coll a little bit.

	* match.c (h_coll, v_collect): Only throw an error about
	missing required variables if the collect iteration collected some new
	variables.  This allows strict collects with :vars to have
	some cases which explicitly match and skip unwanted material,
	without binding variables.  Also, print all missing variables in the
	diagnostic.

	* txr.1: Mention this special exception.

	* RELNOTES: Updated.

	Bug #34866

	* match.c (h_skip): Bugfix. Return the length of the line if
	the skip is to the end of line, not the value t.

	* txr.1: Clarify that @var@(skip)text is useless.

2011-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (v_deffilter): Even better. Just evaluate
	the arguments individually. Now @(deffilter a b ..)
	is possible where these evaluate to suitable
	lists of strings.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2011-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	deffilter grows in power: it can take quasistrings.

	* lib.c (cdr_f): New global variable.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2011-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (yybadtoken): Use ~a to print bad character rather than #\
	notation.

2011-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y: Regression IDENT, '{' and '}'
	must be on the same precedence level and right
	associative. Without this consective braced
	variables don't work, etc.

2011-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* gc.c (mark_mem_region): Use the Valgrind API only to mark
	the type field as accessible, not the whole object that
	we are checking. Marking the whole object accessible hides
	uninitialized field bugs!

	* lib.c: And found a bug already: lazy_str was not completely
	initializing all of the object fields (ls.prefix, ls.list)
	before invoking memory allocating operations, making it
	possible for the garbage collector to encounter uninitialized
	object areas.

2011-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Added a JSON parsing test case. This flushed out a bug which crashed
	the garbage collector (uninitialized fields in function objects).

	* Makefile: Defined TXR_ARGS and TXR_OPTS for new test case.

	* hash.c (hash_begin): Construction of cobj modified to obey
	the correct procedure described in HACKING.

	* parser.y (some_clause, elem): SOME syntax adjusted.

	* txr.1: Documented new :resolve keyword in @(some).

2011-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Adding quote and unquote read syntax to list forms, resembling
	Lisp. The difference is that splice is spelled ,* because @
	already means something, and that there is only one quote operator.
	None of this does anything; it is only syntax.

	* lib.c (quote_s, qquote_s, unquote_s, splice_s): New variables.
	(obj_init): New variables initialized.

	* lib.h (quote_s, qquote_s, unquote_s, splice_s): Declared.

	* parser.l: Added recognition rules.

	* parser.y (SPLICE): New symbolic token.
	(list): Added new syntax for quote and splicing.

2011-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (h_fun, v_fun): Bugfix! copy_list should be used for copying
	the bindings, not copy_alist. Otherwise functions cannot destructively
	update a binding, which is useless. We want a function not to
	manipulate the binding list, but to be able to manipulate the
	contents of bindings.
	(match_files_ctx): Declaration moved ahead of match_line.
	(v_fun): Forward declaration added.
	(match_line): Allow vertical functions to be called from
	a horizontal context, in a limited way.

	* txr.1: Mention the possibility of a call from a horizontal
	context falling back on a vertical function.

2011-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y: Bugfix: precedence of { } must be low, close to that of
	IDENT, otherwise @{var}@(foo) doesn't parse.

2011-11-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Allow directives after variable to be a kind of negative match.

	* match.c (search_form): bugfix: return correct match extent.

	* parser.y: Adjusting associativity and precedence of directives, IDENT,
	and grouping tokens once again. This is so that a var followed by
	a directive will turn into one elem, rather than the var being
	reduced to an elem first.

	* txr.1: Revised documentation to mroe clearly define the concept
	of a negative match, broken into subsections. Some sections
	belonging to syntax were moved to an appropriate location.
	Subsections added to description of form syntax.
	Explanation of directive-driven syntax.

2011-11-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Variable matches can span over function calls.
	Function calls following variables have searching semantics.

	* match.c (ml_specline_pos, search_form): New static functions.
	(h_var): Handle functions and regexes in a common way.

	* parser.y: Adjusted precedence of IDENT and ( so that
	@var@(func) are parsed into a single var element.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2011-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.vim: Update for new character constant syntax.

2011-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (h_var): when manipulating specline, propagate the
	source locatio info.
	(v_skip): Don't use specline for trace messages, because
	it may be nil. Use the skip spec.

	* parser.h (rl): Declared.
	(rlcp): New inline function.

	* parser.y (rl): Static declaration removed. Function becomes
	extern.
	(clause): Propagate location info from clause to clause list
	backbone.
	(collect_clause, COLL): Bugfix: car/cdr mixup in location info.
	(elem): Use rlcp function to abbreviate code.
	(o_elems_opt, o_elems_opt2, o_elem): Set location info.

2011-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Changing read syntax for character literals, because we are going to
	need the single quote in the Lisp way for suppressing evaluation,
	eventually.

	I'm going with a Scheme-compatible syntax for character literals.
	It has a richer repertoire of standard character names than Common
	Lisp, and has a x convention for coding characters in hex.

	* lib.c (obj_print): Print characters in a Scheme-like way.

	* parser.h (end_of_char): New function declared.

	* parser.l (grammar): Implement rules for #\ syntax, with
	involving new HASH_BACKSLASH token.
	(end_of_regex): Enhancement: added check that end_of_regex is
	called in correct state, like the one in end_of_char.
	(end_of_char): New function.

	* parser.y (repeat_rep_helper, o_elems_transform, define_transform,
	lit_char_helper): Functions changed to static.
	(rl): Function moved down, past the grammar section.
	(HASH_BACKSLASH): New terminal symbol.
	(chrlit): Grammar redesigned.
	(char_from_name): New function.

	* txr.1: Character syntax documented.

2011-11-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfix: horizontal directives were being treated as vertical,
	and the trailing material silently ignored.
	For instance @(bind a 1)@(bind b 2). This was going to v_bind,
	v_bind does not check for the trailing material and doe snot
	call decline_s. The result was that b was not bound.
	Correct behavior is to process these binds in match_line.

	* match.c (match_line): Check if a directive IS found in the vertical
	table, and if so report a different error message. The fallback
	case is that there is no such function or directive.
	(v_next): Do not check for obsolete syntax any more. This case
	will not occur any more due to the following changes.
	(match_files): Do not defer opening the file if the data starts
	with an incorrectly written next directive.
	Do not look up and process a vertical directive or function
	call if it is followed by more material in the same line.
	Thus vertical directives can longer receive trailing material.
	This fixes the bug of horizontal directives being treated as
	vertical

2011-11-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* debug.c (debug): Eliminated duplicate code.
	Implemented better way of printing character context.

	(match_line, match_files): Call debug_check to give debugger a chance
	to instrument call.
	(v_fun): Use debug_begin and debug_end macros to set up a debug frame
	for backtracing. Call debug_check to give debugger a chance to
	instrument call.

	* stream.c (struct strm_ops): New function pointer, flush.

	(dest_bind, v_output, v_eof): Use debuglf instead of
	debugf, and sem_error instead of uw_throwf.
	(match_files): Likewise, and file_err is called
	with form.

2011-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Eliminate line numbers from the abstract syntax
	tree representation of the TXR query.

	* match.c (debuglf, sem_error, file_err, eval_form): Line number argument replaced
	with the form to which the situation pertains. Location information is
	pulled from the hash table entry associated with the form.

	renamed since it isn't a line number.
	(struct match_line_ctx): spec_lineno member removed.
	(ml_all, ml_bindings_specline): lineno parameter removed.
	(LOG_MISMATCH, LOG_MATCH, h_var, h_skip, h_coll, h_parallel,
	match_line): Pass elem to debuglf instead of line number.
	as context.
	(h_trailer, h_eol): define elem for LOG_MISMATCH and LOG_MATCH macros.
	(h_fun): Pass elem variable to debuglf instead of line number.
	Body stored as a simple cons cell once again (no line number).
	(do_output_line): Line number parameter removed. Pass specline to
	sem_error instead of line number.
	(do_output): Adjusted for one less parameter in do_output_line.
	(mf_from_ml): Pass one less parameter to ml_all. Conversion of
	specline to spec is just a wrapping into a nested list,
	with no line number.
	(spec_bind): Linenumber variable parameter removed from macro.
	Definition simplified.
	(v_skip): Pass specline to debuglf instead of spec_linenum,
	which is no longer computed.
	(v_trailer): Use new definition of specline. Pass first_spec
	to sem_error instead of spec_linenum.
	Computation of ff_specline no longer has to skip line number.
	(v_freeform, v_block, v_accept_fail, v_next, v_parallel, v_gather,
	v_collect, v_merge, v_bind, hv_trampoline, v_cat, v_output,
	v_try, v_defex, v_throw, v_deffilter, v_filter, match_funcall): Use new
	definition of specline.  Pass first_spec to sem_error instead of
	spec_linenum.  (v_forget_local): Specline computed differently since
	there is no linenumber to skip.
	(h_define): Back to implified representation of function with
	no extra cell for line number.
	(v_define, v_fun): Pass first_spec to sem_error instead of
	spec_linenum. Back to implified representation of function with no

	* parser.h (source_loc): Declared.

	* parser.l (source_loc): New function.

	* parser.y:x (grammar): Removed line numbers from abstract sytnax
	tree. A few more places needed the annotation of forms with location
	info, and a couple of cases of the need to propagate the info was
	identified. Use extra cons cell as output of until_last to propagate
	the line number from the symbol to the use.

	* txr.c (remove_hash_bang_line): No longer has to look past
	line number.

2011-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Refactoring match_files to make it easier to break up into
	subfunctions, similarly to what was done with match_files.

	* match.c (match_line_ctx): New struct type.
	(ml_all, ml_specline, ml_bindings_specline): New functions.
	(LOG_MISMATCH, LOG_MATCH): Macros moved outside of function,
	updated to refer to structure members rather than local
	variables.
	(match_line): Takes only one argument now.
	All recursive calls updated.
	(v_freeform): Call to match_line updated.
	(match_files): Likewise.

	Task #11425

	* match.c (v_accept_fail, v_next, v_parallel, v_collect,
	v_flatten, v_forget_local, v_merge, v_bind, v_cat, v_output,
	v_try, v_define, v_defex, v_throw, v_deffilter, v_eof):
	New functions.
	(match_files): Remaining directives moved to functions.
	(dir_tables_init): New functions entered into hash table.

2011-10-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Hashing of pointers should take into
	account alignment, otherwise only values divisible by the
	alignment occur. This patch takes into considerations that
	val values are pointers to object descriptors in a heap which
	are four words wide, and so most likely aligned to 16 byte
	boundaries (32 bit systems) or 32 byte boundaries (64 bit).
	We need to shift.

2011-10-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11425

	* match.c (v_block): New function.
	(match_files): Block directive moved to function.
	(dir_tables_init): v_block entered into table.

2011-10-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11425

	* match.c (spec_bind): New macro.
	(v_freeform): New function.
	(match_files): Freeform logic moved to function.
	(dir_tables_init): v_freeform entered into table.

2011-10-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11425

	* match.c (same_data_k): Symbol variable renamed to next_spec_k.
	(v_skip): Restructured not to return next_spec_k when there
	are no more specs, but rather thread directly to what match_file
	will do anyway, namely return the bindings and data position.
	(v_trailer): New functions.
	(match_files): Trailer logic moved to function.
	(syms_init): Follows renaming of variable.
	(dir_tables_init): GC bugfix: did not protect global hash
	tables again, like in filter.c previously.

2011-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11425

	Vertical skip directive moved into function dispatched
	via hash table. Test suite passes.

	* lib.c (cptr_s): New symbol variable.
	(cptr_equal_op): New static function.
	(cptr_equal_op, cptr, cptr_get): New functions.
	(cptr_ops): New static structure.
	(obj_init): New variable initialized.

	* lib.h (cptr_s, cptr, cptr_get): Declared.

	* match.c (decline_k, same_data_k): New symbol variables.
	(v_match_func): New typedef.
	(v_skip): New function.
	(match_files): Check symbol in v_directive_table and dispatch
	the associated function if an entry exists.
	Skip directive handling moved to v_skip function.
	(syms_init): Initialize new symbol variables.
	(dir_tables_init): Enter v_skip into v_directive_table under
	skip_s symbol.

2011-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Quick and dirty port to MinGW.

	* configure: Test for presence of <sys/wait.h> added.
	Conditionally generates HAVE_SYS_WAIT variable in config.h.

	* stream.c: Include <sys/wait.h> conditionally.
	(pipe_close): Do not test ermination status with WIFEXITED, etc.
	if there is no <sys/wait.h> header.

2011-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: reduced post-configure advice to just point
	to the INSTALL guide.

	* INSTALL: New file.

2011-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* filter.c (trie_filter_string): Fix warning about uninitialized
	variable (not a bug, but compiler cannot prove that).

2011-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Task #11425. Refactoring match_files to make it easier to
	break up into subfunctions. Arguments are packaged into a structure,
	so that subfunctions won't have to all have big argument lists.

	* match.c (h_directive_table, v_directive_table): New variables.
	(match_files_ctx): New structure.
	(mf_all, mf_args, mf_data, mf_spec, mf_spec_bindings): New functions.
	(match_files): Takes only one argument now, the context
	structure. data_lineno variable is a dynamic number.
	Recursive calls to match_files are handled by creating contexts
	as appropriate with the helper functions.
	The old local variable data is now part of the context.
	(syms_init, dir_tables_init): New functions.
	(match_init): Just calls syms_init and dir_tables_init.

2011-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Fixed broken GC on x86_64 (Ubuntu 11, gcc 4.5.2). 
	The issues is that due to the aggressive function inlining
	in the gc module, the mark_mem_region function is not real
	subroutine. The address of its local variable &gc_stack_top
	ended up excluding the machine context saved by setjmp in
	the parent function. I.e. the buffer was not between the
	computed stack top and bottom. Thus registers were not being
	scanned for references to values. I added a little abstraction
	to the machine context in the process of fixing this.

	* gc.c (struct mach_context, mach_context_t): New type.
	(save_context): New macro.
	(mark): Takes two new arguments, pointer to the stack top and
	machine context. It scans the machine context explicitly rather
	than relying it to be on the stack, between the top and bottom.
	This context is in fact only object within the garbage collector part
	of the activation chain that we need to scan.
	(gc): Use new abstraction to save machine context. Local variable
	is used to derive the stack top here. The stack top is the top
	of the stack above the activation frames in the garbage collector
	itself. The gc has nothing on its stack that should be scanned,
	except for the machine context, which is now handled explicitly.

2011-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: POSIX Portability. Use = instead of ==
	in test expressions.  This was revealed by ubuntu's dash.

2011-10-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (elem): Amending previous change. A single space
	should only denote multiple spaces, not mixtures of spaces and
	tabs. WE have to be careful with tabs because they can be
	semantically different from spaces (e.g. file with tab delimited
	fields which can be blank, empty or have leading or trailing spaces.)

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-10-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (%.ok: %.txr): Use unified diff for showing
	differences between expected and actual test output.

	* parser.l (yybadtoken): Handle new terminal symbol, SPACE.
	New rule for producing SPACE token out of an extent of
	tabs and spaces.

	* parser.y (SPACE): New terminal symbol.
	(o_var): New nonterminal.  I noticed that the var rule was
	being used for output elements, and the var rule refers to
	elem rather than o_elem. A new o_var rule is a simplified
	duplicate of var.
	(elem): Handle SPACE token. Transform to regex if it is
	a single space, otherwise to literal text.
	(o_elem): Handle SPACE token in output.

	* tests/001/query-2.txr: This query depends on matching
	single spaces and so needs to use escapes.

	* tests/001/query-4.txr, test/001/query-4.expected: New test
	case, based on query-2.txr.  It produces the same output,
	but is simpler thanks to the new semantics of space.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2011-10-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bug #34538

	* lib.h (wli): This macro now does the pointer displacement by 1.
	(auto_str, static_str): #if/#else/#endif gone. These functions just
	add the type tag. The + 1 logic was incorrect; it should have
	been + sizeof(wchar_t). But even that was not right because other
	code expects a wchli_t * to point to the first character,
	such as the string_out_put_char function.

2011-10-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Improved support for broken unicode.
	Regex support for extra-large character sets not compiled in
	if wchar_t is not wide enough for it.
	The utf-8 properly throws exceptions when encountering characters
	that it cannot represent, instead of silently ignoring the
	situation and continuing with incorrectly computed data.

	* regex.c (FULL_UNICODE): New macro.
	(CHAR_SET_L3, CHAR_SET_L2_LO, CHAR_SET_L2_HI): Only defined
	if full unicde is available.
	(CHSET_XLARGE, cset_L3_t, struct xlarge_char_set,
	L2_full, L3_fill_range, L3_contains): Ditto.
	(unon char_set): Member x1 present only under FULL_UNICODE.
	(char_set_destroy, char_set_add, char_set_add_range,
	char_set_contains): CHSET_XLARGE cases only available on
	FULL_UNICODE.
	(char_set_compile): Default cst variable to CHSET_LARGE.

	* utf8.c (FULL_UNICODE): New macro.
	(conversion_error): New function.
	(utf8_from_uc): Throw error if not FULL_UNICODE and character is
	outside the BMP.
	(utf8_decode): Likewise.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* HACKING: Documented portability hacks for narrow wchar_t.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 039

	Ported to Cygwin.

	Horizontal modes for @(trailer), @(skip).

	New :greedy keyword in skip which can be given instead of max
	distance to give it longest match semantics.

	@(collect) and @(coll) support a new clause, @(last).

	The :times keyword in @(collect) and @(coll) introduced in the
	previous release has a different meaning. The keywords :mintimes
	and :maxtimes are added, and :maxtimes behaves like :times
	did previously.

	There is a :vars keyword in @(collect) and @(coll) to have
	some control over what bindings are collected, as well
	as error checking for missing bindings and defaulting behavior.

	New @(eol) directive for explicitly matching the end of
	the input or end of a line.

	New lexical syntax: @(...) and @abc is allowed within expressions.
	This produces a special structural syntax with no assigned meaning yet.

	Awful bug fixed in function calling: if a function was called with
	multiple unbound variables, and bindings were produced for them,
	only one variable was being propagated to the calling environment.

	Bugfixes to binding environment handling in the face of
	@(local)/@(forget) directive.

	Fix for the issue of unbound variables being silently ignored
	in some contexts, like quasiliterals. An exception is now thrown.

	Bugfix for an issue with consecutive variables in output.

	Bugfix for an issue with horizontal @(cases) not collecting
	bindings.

	Bugfix for an issue with @(until) inside @(coll) not seeing
	bindings from main clause.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	One more swing at this with the axe.

	* lib.h (wini, wref): New macros.

	* stream.c (string_out_put_char): Rewritten with macros to eliminate
	preprocessor #if test.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.h (wli, lit_noex): We need null characters on both ends
	so that this hack is correct for null strings. When recovering
	the wchar_t pointer from a null literal object, we wil increment
	unconditionally, since it always points to a null character.
	We end up skipping past null terminator #1, but safely landing on #2.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Following up to previous commit's TODO.

	* filter.c (struct filter_par): wchar_t becomes wchli_t.

	* lib.h (wchli_t): New type: an incomplete structure type,
	so that a pointer to this type is incompatible with anything else.
	(wli): Macro produces const wchli_t * pointer instead of
	const wchar_t *.
	(auto_str, static_str): Accept a const wchli_t * instead
	of const wchar_t *, making it impossible to misuse these
	functions by passing in a literal.

	* stream.c (string_out_put_char): These type changes showed
	this hack to have a bug. Confronted with the need to cast
	from const wchar_t * to const wchli_t *, it's obvious that
	the conversion has to be done properly with the + 1 in the
	one platform case, but not the other.

	* txr.c (version): Type changed to const wchli_t.

	* txr.h (version): Declaration updated.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Ported to Cygwin.

	TODO: there should be some type safety with the new wli macro
	so that if it is forgotten, there will be a diagnostic.

	* configure (lit_align): New configuration variable
	and configuration test. Generates LIT_ALIGN in config.h.
	Fixed the integer-holds-pointer test for the different output
	from the nm program on Cygwin. The arrays become common symbols
	marked C which do not show an offset attribute, only size:
	one less column.

	* filter.c (to_html_table, from_html_table): wrap wide string
	literals with the wli macro. This must be done from now on for
	all literals and initializes of arrays that are going to be
	directly converted to type tagged val-s.

	* lib.h (wli): New macro.
	(auto_str, static_str, litptr, lit_noex): Handle wide literals on
	platforms where they are aligned to only two bytes, such that we don't
	have two bits in the pointer. We can still add our 11 bit type tag, but
	then when recovering the pointer to the data, we have may have
	to fix up the pointer. 

	* parser.l: Another portability issue here. Flex generates a scanner
	which has #include <unistd.h> in the middle, after the source file's
	own #includes which can introduce macros. On Cygwin, there is some
	hygiene problem whereby our "noreturn" macro causes the <unistd.h>
	header to generate bad syntax and fail to compile. Stupid Cygwin
	and even stupider flex! The workaround is to include <unistd.h>
	at the top in the flex source.

	* stream.c (string_out_put_char): This is one more place where
	the string literal handling hack spreads.

	* txr.c (version): Wrap string in wli.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* dep.mk: Regenerated. Too easy to neglect this file.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (vars_to_bindings): Regression fix: recent commit
	caused test failure. An empty list not treated as a valid collect
	variable list.

2011-10-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* configure: Fixed indentation.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Removed references to obsolete @(next) variant.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (vars_to_bindings): New function.
	(match_line): keyword argument :vars implemented for coll.

	* txr.1: Documented :vars.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (vars_k): New symbol variable.
	(match_files): Implemented :vars in collect.
	(match_init): New symbol variable initialized.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Augment example of @/.*/ being used to skip to the
	end of the line with @(skip) which is now better style,
	since it avoids reaching for regexes.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line): Skip directive bugfix. If skip is the
	last item on the line, it must match the whole line by returning
	success.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (mintimes_k, maxtimes_k): New keyword variables.
	(match_line): Implemented :mintimes and :maxtimes, changing
	the semantics of :times.
	(match_files): Likewise.
	(match_init): New keyword variables initialized.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* HACKING: Formatting.

2011-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Fixed spectacular bug in function calling,
	dating back to before October 2009 when txr was put into git.
	Basically, unbound variables were not handled right after
	the function return, due to the increment step being wrongly
	written as ``piter = cdr(aiter)'' in the for loop that processes the
	ub_p_a_pairs. Evil cut and paste!

2011-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (greedy_k): New keyword symbol variable.
	(match_line): Greedy skip implemented.
	(match_files): Likewise.
	(match_init): New keyword symbol variable initialized.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (eol_s): New symbol variable.
	(obj_init): New variable initialized.

	* lib.h (eol_s): Declared.

	* match.c (match_line): Implemented horizontal skip as and
	new eol directive.
	(match_lines): Vertical skip defers to horizontal skip if
	there is trailing material.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (flatten_helper): Function removed.
	(flatten): Recurse directly, using func_n1.

2011-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: fxed wrong word.

2011-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Extending syntax to allow for @VAR and @(...) forms inside
	nested lists. This is in anticipation of future features.

	* lib.c (expr_s): New symbol variable.
	(obj_init): expr_s initialized.

	* lib.h (expr_s): Declared.

	* match.c (dest_bind): Now takes linenum. Tests for the meta-syntax
	denoted by the system symbols var_s and expr_s, and throws an
	error.
	(eval_form): Similar error checks added. Also, hack: do not add
	file and line number to an exception which begins with a '('
	character; just re-throw it. This suppresses duplicate line
	number addition when this throw occurs across some nestings.
	(match_files): Updated calls to dest_bind.

	* parser.l (yybadtoken): Handle new token kind, METAVAR and METAPAR.
	(grammar): Refactoring among patterns: TOK broken into
	SYM and NUM, NTOK introduced, unused NUM_END removed.
	Rule for @( producing METAPAR in nested state.

	* parser.y (METAVAR, METAPAR): New tokens.
	(meta_expr): New nonterminal.
	(expr): meta_expr and META_VAR productions handled.

2011-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Renaming the currying combinators according to new scheme.

	* lib.c (bind2): Function renamed to curry_12_2.
	(bind2other): Function renamed to curry_12_1.
	(do_bind_2, do_bind2other): Helpers renamed likewise.
	(tree_find): Follows rename of bind2.

	* match.c (match_files): deffilter code follows bind2 rename
	to curry_12_2.

2011-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (funcall3, curry_123_2): New functions.
	(do_curry_123_2): New static function.

	* lib.h (funcall3, curry_123_2): Declared.

	* match.c (subst_vars): Bugfix: throw error on unbound variable instead
	of ignoring the situation. This bug caused unbound variables in
	quasiliterals to be silently ignored.
	(eval_form): Function changed to three argument form, so that
	it takes a line number for reporting errors. Restructured to catch
	the new unbound variable exception from subst_vars, and re-throw
	it with a line number. Also, throws exception now instead of returning
	nil if itself it detets an unbound variable. Uses of eval_form
	no longer have to test the return value for nil, but just assume
	it worked.
	(match_lines): Currying calls to eval form updated to use
	curry_123_2. Test of eval return value eliminated. In function
	calls, eval isn't used for reducing symbol arguments to values,
	because it now throws in the unbound case, and it's not worth
	setting up a catch for this. Instead, assoc is used directly.

2011-10-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): In function calls, the deletion of
	the unbound variable from the argument list can be done
	with a destructive operation since that list is a copy.

2011-10-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* LICENSE, Makefile, configure, filter.c, filter.h, gc.c, gc.h, hash.c,
	hash.h, lib.c, lib.h, match.c, match.h, parser.h, parser.l, parser.y,
	regex.c, regex.h, stream.c, stream.h, txr.1, txr.c, txr.h, unwind.c,
	unwind.h, utf8.c, utf8.h: Updated e-mail address.

2011-10-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line, match_files): Another correction to how bindings
	are handled in collect/coll. New bindings from the main clause and
	last clause must override old bindings. This is done by some
	additional set difference operations based on symbol identity.
	Otherwise it is possible to end up with multiple bindings for the
	same symbol, which is untidy. If the collect clause scrubs a variable
	with forget and re-binds it, then combining that environment 
	with the previous bindings will create a duplicate.
	Also, fixed a serious bug with the bindings from the last clause;
	the append was wrongly put into the loop that processes the collected
	lists.

2011-10-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (acons): New function.
	(set_diff): Optimize common case: list1 and list2
	are the same, or list2 is substructure of list1.
	Situations in which this won't be the case for variable bindings are
	rare.

	* lib.h (acons): Declared.

	* match.c (match_line): Use acons rather than acons_new, when binding
	variables that we know are new (the symbol is unbound). 
	When computing the set difference over bindings, use cons cell
	equality, rather than symbol equality. Symbol equality is wrong
	because a binding can be removed, and then a new binding can be
	introduced using the same symbol. This must be treated as
	a different binding.

2011-10-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Bugfixes to the semantics of binding environments, which
	were broken in the face of deletions (local, forget).
	For some stupid reason, I had written a destructive routine for
	removing elements from an association list, and used it
	as the basis for the local and forget directives.

	* lib.c (eq_f, car_f): New variables.
	(identity_tramp, equal_tramp): Obsolete functions removed.
	(apply): Broken function disabled at run time.
	(funcall, funcall1, funcall2): Throw meaningful error instead
	of aborting.
	(alist_remove_test): New static function.
	(alist_remove, alist_remove1): Rewritten to be functional
	rather than destructive.
	(alist_nremove, alist_nremove1): Destructive functions,
	using previous implementations of alist and alist_nremove.
	(do_sort): Recurses directly rather than via sort. That was
	probably why this helper was introduced!
	(find, set_diff): New functions.
	(obj_init): gc-protect new variables eq_f and car_f, and initialize
	them. Initializations for equal_f and identity_f changed to
	use equal and identity directly, without the obsolete wrappers.

	* lib.h (eq_f, car_f, alist_nremove, alist_nremove1,
	find, set_diff): Declared.

	* match.c (match_line): Use set_diff to determine what bindings
	are new, rather than ldiff and ldiff-like logic which break when
	the new bindings do not share structure with the old.
	(match_files): Likewise.

2011-10-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Starte dodcumenting the forgotten merge directive.

2011-10-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Implemented new last clause for collect and coll.
	Bugfix in cases inside coll: was not collecting bindings.
	Bugfix for until inside coll: was not seeing bindings
	from main clause.

	* lib.c (ldiff): New function.

	* lib.h (ldiff): Declared.

	* match.c (match_line): Implemented last clause. Fixed cases
	handling by moving misplaced termination check.
	(match_files): Implemented last clause.

	* parser.y (until_last): New nonterminal symbol.
	(collect_clause): Refactored syntax to support until and last.
	(elem): Likewise.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-10-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (rep_elem): Bugfix: forgotten o_elems_transform on
	syntax tree of o_elems constituent, leading to problems with
	consecutive variables in a @(rep).

2011-10-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line): Handle trailer_s directive.
	(match_files): Remove check against trailer_s not having trailing
	material. If it doesn't, it's a vertical directive processed here,
	otherwise leave it alone so match_line processed it.

2011-10-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Compiles as C++ again.

	* lib.h (cons_set): New macro.

	* match.c (match_line, match_files): In collect clause handlers,
	move variable declarations above goto, and initialize with
	cons_set, instead of declaring and initializing with cons_bind.
	This eliminates the stupid C++ error that goto skips a variable
	initialization (which happens even when it can be trivially
	proven that the has no next use at the goto site!)

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 038

	New eof directive.

	Fixes in skip directive to work very well with eof.

	Consecutive variable matching semantics improved; concept of double
	variable match introduced for unbound variable followed by
	regex variable.

	Directives collect and coll have keyword arguments for more control
	over their behavior.

	Parallel directives (all, some, none, ...) are available in
	horizontal mode.

	New choose directive for selecting one of numerous alternatives

	GC bugfix in new filtering code.

	The code has an issue compling with GNU C++ instead of C,
	which is something that is supported by this project.
	Not a release-blocking issue. Not easy to fix without
	restructuring some code.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped.

	* txr.1: Bumped version and set date.

	* configure (txr_ver): Bumped.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Maintaining C++ compiling (except for two issues that will
	need another commit).

	* filter.c: Include "gc.h" for prototype of protect.
	(struct filter_pair): Use const wchar_t *, so we can assign
	literals.
	(html_hex_continue): Ditto.

	* lib.c (and): Function renamed to andf, since and is a C++
	operator.

	* lib.h (and): Declaration renamed.

	* match.c (match_files): Use of and updated to andf.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	HACKING: Clarified that --vg-debug is also needed to turn on on
	the Valgrind support at run-time, in addition to building it in.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* filter.c (filters, filter_init): Serious gc bug fixed: neglected to
	inform the garbage collector about the filters global variable.
	Ouch!

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New test case under tests/008.

	* Makefile: Made previous TXR_ARGS for 008 specific
	to tokenizing test case, and introduced separate TXR_ARGS
	for this test case.

	* tests/008/configfile: New file.

	* tests/008/configfile.expected: New file.

	* tests/008/configfile.txr: New file.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Tokenizing test case, exercising for @(coll :gap 0)
	and horizontal @(choose :shortest ...).

	* Makefile: Defined TXR_ARGS for tests/008 directory.

	* tests/008/data: New file.
	* tests/008/tokenize.expected: New file.
	* tests/008/tokenize.txr: New file.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile (TEST): Test targets marked as .PHONY, because they are.

	* tests/007/except-1.expected: New file.
	* tests/007/except-1.txr: New file.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y (all_clause, some_clause, none_clause, maybe_clause,
	cases_clause, choose_clause, elem): Regression bug fix: bad list calls
	in parser, lacking nao terminator.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Regression bug fix: longest match variables broken by
	2011-09-28 commit which introduced the double var match.

	* match.c (match_line): Handle case where modifier is t.

	* parser.y (var_op): Produce modifir as (t) rather than t.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Documented choose and horizontal mode for paralle
	constructs.

2011-10-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

2011-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* txr.1: Clarified consecutive variables and documented double
	variable match.

2011-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.l: Implemented backslash continuations in SPECIAL
	state, regexes and string literals.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2011-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line): Implemented horizontal all, some,
	none, maybe and cases directives.
	(match_files): Recognize horizontal version of these directives
	by the presence of the extra symbol t and do not process.
	Also, bugfix in the all directive: not resetting the
	all_match flag when short circuiting out.
	* parser.y (clause_parts_h, additional_parts_h): New nonterminals.
	(elem): New clauses added.

2011-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (chars_k): New variable.
	(match_line): Keyword arguments in coll implemented.
	(match_init): chars_k variable initialized.

	* parser.l (COLL): Lexical syntax changed to allow for
	argument material.

	* parser.y (elem): Coll syntax rewritten for arguments.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-09-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (mingap_k, maxgap_k, gap_k, times_k, lines_k): New
	symbol variables.
	(match_lines): Keyword arguments in collect implemented.
	(match_init): New function.

	* match.h (match_init): Declared.

	* parser.l (COLLECT): Lexical syntax changed for COLLECT to
	allow for argument material.

	* parser.y (%union): obj renamed to val.
	(exprs_opt): New nonterminal.
	(collect_clause): Rewritten for arguments.

	* txr.c (main): Call to match_init introduced.

2011-09-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line): Bugfix in double var. Do not
	prepend the next_pat to the specline if it is nil.

2011-09-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_line): Logic restructured to allow for
	regex variables which also have nested variables.
	Previously this code was assuming that the cases were
	mutually exclusive, and the parser happened to work that way.
	Also, added support for a "double var" match which occurs
	when an unbound variable is followed by a regex variable.
	This case should be allowed because it makes sense.
	It's similar to a variable followed by a regex, except
	that the regex is also a variable binding.

	* parser.y (o_elems_transform): New function.
	(o_elems_opt, o_elems_opt2, quasilit): Transform o_elems with new
	function. This is needed because subst_vars doesn't
	deal with the nested var syntax for consecutive variables.
	(var): New syntax case '{' IDENT exprs '}' elem. This
	allows consecutive variables to be nested in all cases.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y ('{', '}'): Nope, still not right.
	These must have exactly the same precedence as
	IDENT for this to work right, of course.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* parser.y ('{', '}'): Bugfix: precedence of these
	terminals was causing @foo@foo to be parsed differently
	from @foo@{foo}. We need consecutive variables to be
	specially folded in the syntax under a single var_s
	node.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): One more fix to this, argh.
	The test for !data should be done after matching,
	before incrementing to the next line. Then it is a true
	bottom of the loop test. This commit allows
	@(skip)
	@first_line
	@(skip nil 3)
	@(eof)
	to correctly match the first line of the input, not
	the fourth one from the bottom, since the
	second skip has an unbounded range.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Another bugfix to skip.
	If a hard skip tries to go beyond EOF, then the query
	must fail. However, a skip to exactly EOF is fine.
	I.e. data can hit nil at the same time as the right
	number of skip iterations is performed.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Bugfix in skip directive.
	We should try the match at least once even if there is no data
	after a hard skip, so that the query has an opportunity
	to do an explicit match for no data, as with @(endp).
	This commit makes possible queries like:
	@fourth_line_from_bottom
	@(skip 1 3)
	@(eof)
	This query depends on @(skip 1 3) not failing when
	it runs out of data, because @(eof) checks for htis.

2011-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* lib.c (eof_s): New symbol variable.
	(obj_init): New variable initialized.

	* lib.h (eof_s): Declared.

	Implementation of deffilter.

	* txr.1: Documented deffilter.

2011-09-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Trie compression. Hash table iteration.

	Output directive refactored to parse keywords, extract the
	filter and pass down to do_output.

	* parser.y (regex): Generate (sys:regex regex syntax ...)
	instead of (regex syntax ...).

2011-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* LICENSE, Makefile, configure, gc.c, gc.h, hash.c, hash.h, lib.c,
	lib.h, match.c, match.h, parser.h, parser.l, parser.y, regex.c,
	regex.h, stream.c, stream.h, txr.1, txr.c, txr.h, unwind.c, unwind.h,
	utf8.c, utf8.h: Updated copyright year.

2011-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c, parser.y: Support for old output syntax removed.
	Leading :nothrow with trailing material is an error now.

	* txr.1: Updated. Made note of errors in pipes being asynchronous.

2011-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* tests/002/query-1.txr: Old next syntax rewritten to new.

2011-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Some cleanup in preparation of new
	features. Support for obsolescent @(next) syntax is gone.

2011-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Semantics tweak: short circuiting behavior for @(all) and @(none).

	* match.c (match_files): Added a couple of break statements.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2011-09-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Version 036

	Extension to @(skip).

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 036.

	* txr.1: Set version to 036.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 036.

2011-09-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Useful second argument in skip directive for skipping
	a minimum number of lines.

	* match.c (match_files): New behavior in skip_s case.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2010-10-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 035

	Fixes garbage-collection-related problem affecting @(freeform)
	that was revealed by "make tests" on x86-64 system, gcc 4.3.2.

	Fixes show-stopper stupidity, again: a query that matches 
	the end of data terminates successfully rather than failing.  This
	is because version 032 did not properly address the breakage
	introduced in the 2010-01-21 change to match.c involving the dataline
	variable. The "fix" only prevented the program from aborting in that
	situation.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 035.

	* txr.1: Set version to 035.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 035.

2010-10-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Bugfix. A (sub)query that runs out of data
	lines to match must fail. Extra data lines relative to the spec
	are tolerated; extra spec lines unmet by data aren't.

2010-10-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.h (lazy_string): Fix incorrect comment.

	* lib.c (split_str, split_str_set): It is necessary to protect input
	parameters against GC, because we cache their internal pointers,
	after which we no longer refer to the objects themselves. Moreover,
	we perform object allocation, and then keep using the internal
	pointers.

2010-09-30  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fix formatting problem.

2010-03-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fix inaccuracies: files are not read into memory all at
	once, and a query doesn't execute if it had errors.

2010-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 034

	Patched up broken @(freeform) directive.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 034.

	* txr.1: Set version to 034.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 034.

2010-02-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New testcases for freeform.

	* tests/006/data: New UTF-8 file.

	* tests/006/freeform-1.txr: Likewise.

	* tests/006/freeform-1.expected: Likewise.

	* tests/006/freeform-2.txr: Likewise.

	* tests/006/freeform-2.expected: Likewise.

	* Makefile (TXR_ARGS): New target-specific assignment to set
	data for test case set 006.

2010-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (length_str_gt, length_str_ge, length_str_lt, length_str_le):
	Added missing support for literal string type.

2010-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (search_str): Bugfix for empty haystack case: checks for end
	of string must use postincrement on the index, otherwise the access
	goes past the null terminator.

2010-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_lines): Bugfix in freeform directive.
	If the virtual line is partially matched, the remainder of
	the line is folded back into list form. In this case, the
	data line number must be incremented. Otherwise the calling
	context may conclude that no progress was made, and
	skip a line of input. I.e. the unmatched part of the input
	is a new line, even if there had originally
	been no line break at that point.

2010-02-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.h (split_str_sep): Declared.

	* lib.c (split_str_sep): New function. 
	(split_str): Semantics changed; the second argument
	is not a set of separator characters (like in split_str_sep)
	but rather a separator string. Fixed bug: if the input
	string is empty, the output list is empty. This caused
	infinite looping behavior in @(freeform).

2010-02-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (init_str): Bugfix: copy only len characters, not len + 1, so
	that we don't clobber the null terminator in the target string, or try
	read past the end of the source data.  This affects the @(freeform)
	directive.

2010-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 033

	Addressed exponential memory behaviors
	in derivative-based regex matching.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 033.

	* txr.1: Set version to 033.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 033.

2010-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	hash.c (hash_process_weak): There is no point in fixing up
	the type codes of spuriously reached nodes; reached objects
	will not be removed by weak processing and so it's better
	to just detect those situations and short-circuit.

2010-01-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Optimization in derivative-based regex engine.
	Exponential memory consumption behavior was observed when
	matching the input aaaaaa....
	against the regex a?a?a?a?....aaaa....
	The fix is to eliminate common subexpressions
	from the derivative for the or operator.

	* lib.c (memqual, mapcon): New functions

	* lib.h (memqual, mapcon): Declared.

	* regex.c (flatten_or, unflatten_or,
	unique_first, reduce_or): New functions.
	(reg_derivative): Apply reduce_or
	to the constructed disjunction.

2010-01-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fixing weak hash tables.

	* gc.c, gc.h (REACHABLE, FREE): Moved to header.

	* hash.c (hash_mark): Fix broken list push code.
	(has_process_weak): Defend against conservative
	garbage collector. We cannot trust that the
	conses which make up the chain backbone
	and hash entry pairs are unmarked, because the
	hash vectors might be reached through
	spurious references.

2010-01-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 032

	Fix showstopper stupidity.

	* match.c (match_files): Fix incorrect change involving dataline
	variable made on 2010-01-21; failure to check for end of data.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 032.

	* txr.1: Set version to 032.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 032.

2010-01-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 031

	Addresses some spurious object retention problems related to the GC's
	conservative scan of the stack.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 031.

	* txr.1: Set version to 031.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 031.

2010-01-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Workaround for GC issue
	discovered on Red Hat EL 4 with gcc 3.4.3.
	In the collect loop, set car(success) to nil.
	Somehow the generated code hangs on to the last
	matching position for a regex, preventing GC.

2010-01-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* stream.c (vformat_num): Fix bad width calculation.

2010-01-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fix for unbounded memory growth problem reproduced with GCC 4.4.1
	on 32 bit x86 Fedora. This happens because the lazy list variable
	``data'' in the match_files function is optimized to a register,
	but a stale value of that variable persists in the backing storage.

	* gc.h (gc_hint): New macro.
	(gc_hint_func): Declared.

	* gc.c (gc_hint_func): New function.

	* match.c (match_files): Use gc_hint on the data lazy list.

2010-01-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Reduce scope, and bogus use of, dataline
	variable.

2010-01-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 030

	Fixed grammar conflicts.

	R1~R2 syntax supported in regexes.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 030.

	* txr.1: Set version to 030.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 030.

2010-01-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (regex): Getting rid of empty '/' '/' production
	again.
	(regexpr): Re-introducing empty production; this time using
	%prec LOW trick to give this interpretation the lowest
	possible precedence. Thus expressions like /&/ work again.
	(regbranch): New production to allow R1~R2 to be valid.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2010-01-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (grammar): The ^ character is no longer considered
	a special regex token, just a regular character.

	* parser.y (LOW): New phony terminal symbol, used as place holder
	for lowest precedence.
	(grammar): Fixed numerous conflicts in regex section by refactoring.
	The regex nonterminal no longer has an empty derivation.
	A regex character class no longer has an empty derivation; this is
	handled by special rules. Ambiguity around ^ is resolved; this is
	parsed as a regular character and specially recognized.
	Ambiguity between catenation of terms and postfix operators
	resolved in favor of shift by giving catenation low
	precedence using %prec LOW.

2010-01-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 029

	Performance optimizations of derivative-based regexes.

	New syntax: [] and [^].

	Saner semantics for % operator.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 029.

	* txr.1: Set version to 029.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 029.

2010-01-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* regex.c (reg_derivative_list, reg_derivative): Recognition
	of cases to reduce consing. In reg_derivative_list, we avoid
	consing the full or expression if either branch is t, and
	also save a cons when the first element has a null derivative.
	In reg_derivative the oneplus and zeroplus cases are split,
	since zeroplus can re-use the input expression, when it's
	just a one-character match, deriving nil.

2010-01-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Adjust semantics of non-greedy operator R%S, to avoid the broken
	case whereby R%S matches nothing at all when S is not empty
	but equivalent to empty, or more generally when S is nullable.
	A much nicer definition is ``the intersection of R* and
	the set of all strings that do not contain a non-empty substring
	that matches S, followed by S''.

	* regex.c (dv_compile_regex): Adjust syntactic sugar for the %
	operator, taking advantage of the reg_nullable function to keep the
	simpler syntactic sugar for cases where S is not nullable.

	* txr.1: Document accordingly.

2010-01-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (regterm, regclass): Relocate handling
	of empty [] into regterm, via empty derivation.

2010-01-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Regex syntactic tweaks: support the [] syntax
	to match no character and [^] as its complement,
	being synonymous with the wildcard dot.

	* parser.y (regterm): Added new productions.

	* txr.1: Documented.

2010-01-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 028.

	Code cleanup.

	New additional regex implementation using regex derivatives,
	providing new operators: regex complement, intersection,
	non-greedy match.

	Regex syntax bugfixes.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 028.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 028.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 028.

	* match.c (dest_bind): Remove spurious syntax.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Get rid of parens from regex operator descriptions.
	Correct wrong text: all operators can take an empty regex.
	Clarify escaping rules within a character class.
	Describe Kleene and non-greedy behavior more accurately.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* genman.txr, txr.1: Encode version differently; extract
	from text during HTML conversion.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Automate the maintenance of the HTML-ized man page.

	* Makefile (txr-manpage.html): New target, generated from txr.1
	man page.

	* genman.txr: New txr query to transform the output of man2html.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Implemented non-greedy operator.

	* lib.c (nongreedy_s): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): New symbol interned.

	* lib.h (nongreedy_s): Declared.

	* parser.l (grammar): Support % as a regex operator.

	* parser.y (grammar): Define '%' nonterminal,
	on th esame precedence level as '*'.
	(regterm): Add the % expression as a term.
	(regchar): Recognize % as ordinary character in a character
	class. Also, bugfix: recognize & and ~ similarly.

	* regex.c (dv_compile_regex): Implement % as a syntactic sugar
	via an algebraic transformation to a more complex expression.
	(regex_requires_dv): A regex containing the % operator requires
	derivatives.

	* txr.1: Documented %; moved exotic regex notes to end of document.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* regex.c (reg_derivative_list): Bugfix: wrong algebra,
	taking a double derivative of the first item.

2010-01-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fix accidental edit garbage.

2010-01-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fix accidental .b, which should have been .B.
	Revised description of regex operators. Added section
	on intersection and complement, which may not be familiar
	to regex users.

2010-01-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* regex.c (reg_derivative): Bugfix: remove invalid
	algebraic reductions in the derivative for the or operator.

2010-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bugfix: allow unescaped / to be used in regex character classes.

	To do this, we no longer make the lexer look for the terminating
	slash which ends the regex syntax. This is driven by the parser,
	which calls a special function in the lexer to indicate that
	the regex parsing is done.

	* parser.h (end_of_regex): New function declared.

	* parser.l (REGCLASS): Unused start condition removed.
	(grammar): A slash character in the REGEX start condition is now simply
	returned as an operator token; no popping of the state stack takes
	place. The scanner stays in REGEX mode.
	(end_of_regex): New function.

	* parser.y (regex): Call end_of_regex when a regex is successfully
	scanned through to terminating slash, or if a syntax error occurs.
	(regchar): Can derive a / terminal now, thus including it in a
	regex character class.

2010-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (precedence): bugfix: character classes like this [^*]
	being treated as a non-complemented set of two characters.

2010-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Dynamically determine which regex implementation to use:
	NFA or derivatives. The default behavior is NFA, with
	derivatives used if the regular expression contains
	uses of complement or intersection. The --dv-regex
	option forces derivatives always.

	* regex.c (opt_derivative_regex): Default value is 0 now.
	(regex_requires_dv): New function.
	(regex_compile): If regex_requires_dv function reports
	true, or if the opt_derivative_regex flag is true,
	treat the regex with the derivative-based implementation.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Implemented --dv-regex option
	to set the opt_derivative_regex flag.

2010-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.h (c_num): Remove redundant declaration.

2010-01-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Impelement derivative-based regular expressions.

	* lib.c (chset_s, compiled_regex_s): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned.

	* lib.h (chest_s, compiled_regex_s): Declared.

	* match.c (match_line, match_files): Use regexp predicate
	function instead of typeof for detecting regex.

	* parser.y (regexpr, regbranch, regterm): Minor syntactic refactoring.

	* regex.h (union nfa_state, nfa_state_t, struct nfa, enum nfam_result,
	nfa_machine_t, nfa_compile_regex, nfa_free, nfa_run,
	nfa_machine_reset, nfa_machine_init, nfa_machine_cleanup,
	nfa_machine_feed, nfa_machine_match_span, regex_nfa): Declarations
	for internal material removed from header, some moved into regex.c.

	* regex.c: Includes txr.h now to get declaration of new option global.
	(union nfa_state, nfa_state_t, struct nfa,
	nfa_compile_regex, nfa_free, nfa_run, regex_nfa): Declarations
	moved from regex.h.
	(enum nfam_result, nfa_machine_reset, nfa_machine_init,
	nfa_machine_cleanup, nfa_machine_feed, nfa_machine_match_span):
	Renamed from nfam_* and nfa_machine_* to regm_* and regex_machine_*.
	Functions made static. Regex machine is now polymorphic: the
	machine is instantiated based on whether the regex is NFA or
	derivative type, and the behavior of the functions is type dependent.
	(nfa_machine_t): Renamed to regex_machine_t, now typedef name for union
	regex_machine.
	(struct dv_machine, union regex_machine): New types.
	(struct nfa_machine): New member is_nfa. A few members rearranged,
	so that union common members are at the start of the structure.
	(opt_derivative_regex): New global added.
	(char_set_compile, char_set_cobj_destroy): New function.
	(char_set_cobj_ops): New static structure.
	(nfa_compile_set): Refactored to use char_set_compile; made static.
	(nfa_compile_list): New function.
	(nfa_compile_regex): Refactored to follow new syntax from parser.y;
	made static.
	(nfa_free, nfa_run, regex_nfa): Made static.
	(dv_compile_regex, reg_nullable_list, reg_nullable,
	reg_derivative_list, reg_derivative, dv_run): New functions.
	(regex_compile): Can compile either kind of regex now.
	(search_regex, match_regex): Decoupled from dependency on NFA
	implementation.

	* txr.h (opt_derivative_regex): Declared.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2010-01-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Remove incorrect implementation of extended
	regex operations (complement, intersection).
	The syntax extensions documentation are retained.

	* regex.c (struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set, struct
	displaced_char_set): refs field removed.
	(nfa_kind_t): Removed enum members nfa_super_accept,
	nfa_reject, nfa_compl_empty, nfa_compl_wild,
	nfa_compl_single, nfa_compl_set.
	(nfa_super_accept_state, nfa_is_accept_state): Removed.
	(char_set_create, char_set_destroy): Reverted.
	(char_set_clone): Removed.
	(nfa_state_empty_convert, nfa_state_merge): Reverted.
	(nfa_compl_state, nfa_compl): Removed.
	(nfa_compile_regex, nfa_all_states, nfa_closure, nfa_move): Reverted.

2010-01-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Some fine tuning in regex grammar.

	* parser.y (regex): Empty regex handled by
	allowing regex to generate empty, rather than
	a special case production for '/' '/'. Thus
	empty subexpressions are possible.
	(regbranch, regterm): Complement is handled
	in regbranch, so that it has lower precedence
	than aggregation.

2010-01-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Implemented the regular expression ~ and & operators.
	This turns out to be easy to do in NFA land.
	The complement of an NFA has exactly the same number
	and configuration of states and transitions, except
	that the states have an inverted meaning; and furthermore,
	failed character transitions are routed to an extra
	state (which in this impelmentation is permanently
	allocated and shared by all regexes). The regex &
	is implemented trivially using DeMorgan's.

	Also, bugfix: regular expressions like A|B|C are allowed
	now by the syntax, rather than constituting syntax error.
	Previously, this would have been entered as (A|B)|C.

	* lib.c (comp_s, and_s): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned.

	* lib.h (comp_s, and_s): Declared.

	* parser.l (grammar): Provide new ~ and & tokens in REGEX state.

	* parser.y (regexpr): Constituents of '|' are regexprs,
	rather than regbranches (see bugfix note above).
	The '&' operator is added.
	(regterm): The '~' operator is added.

	* regex.c (struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set, struct
	displaced_char_set): refs field added.
	(nfa_kind_t): New enum members nfa_super_accept,
	nfa_reject, nfa_compl_empty, nfa_compl_wild,
	nfa_compl_single, nfa_compl_set.
	(nfa_super_accept_state): New static structure.
	(nfa_is_accept_state): New inline function.
	(char_set_create): Initialize reference count to 1.
	(char_set_destroy): Decrement refcount, free if zero.
	(char_set_clone): New function.
	(nfa_state_empty_convert, nfa_state_merge): Handle nfa_reject state,
	the complement of nfa_accept.
	(nfa_compl_state, nfa_compl): New functions.
	(nfa_compile_regex): Handle new operators.
	(nfa_all_states, nfa_closure): Handle new state types.
	(nfa_move): Handle new types according to special rules:
	the new complemented states that have character transitions have a next
	move to the super-accept state if they do not match the input
	character.
	
	* txr.1: Documented new regex operators.

2009-12-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (make_package, find_package): Eliminate declaration
	in the middle of statement block.

	* lib.h (TAG_MASK): Becomes type cnum rather than long.
	(nao): Based off 1 rather than -1 to avoid left shift of
	negative number.

2009-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (YYINPUT): Fix signed/unsigned comparison.

2009-12-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* hash.c (sethash): New function.

	* hash.h (sethash): Declared.

	* lib.c (cobj_handle): New function.

	* lib.h (cobj_handle): Declared.

2009-12-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	All COBJ operations have default implementations now;
	no null pointer check over struct cobj_ops operations.

	New typechecking function for COBJ objects.

	* gc.c (finalize): Assume function pointer destroy
	is not null.
	(cobj_destroy_op): New function.
	(mark_obj): Assume function pointer mark is not null.
	(cobj_mark_op): New function.

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Assume function pointer hash
	is not null.
	(cobj_hash_op): New function.
	(hash_equal): Function removed.
	(hash_ops): Replaced hash_equal with cobj_equal_op.

	* lib.c (class_check, cobj_equal_op): New functions.

	* lib.h (cobj_equal_op, cobj_destroy_op, cobj_mark_op,
	cobj_hash_op): Declarations added.
	(system_package, user_package, class_check): Declaration added.

	* regex.c (regex_equal): Function removed.
	(regex_obj_ops): regex_equal replaced with cobj_equal_op.

	* stream.c (common_equal): Function removed.
	(stdio_ops, pipe_ops, string_in_ops, byte_in_ops,
	string_out_ops, dir_ops): common_equal replaced
	with cobj_equal_op, and all previously null
	function pointers populated with default functions.

2009-12-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	More void * to mem_t * conversion.

	* stream.c (stdio_put_char_callback, stdio_get_char_callback,
	stdio_put_string, stdio_put_char, stdio_snarf_line, stdio_get_char):
	Convert void * to mem_t *.

	* utf8.c (utf8_encode, utf8_decode): Convert void * to mem_t *.

	* utf8.h (utf8_encode, utf8_decode): Update declarations.

2009-12-04  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Eliminate the void * disease. Generic pointers are of mem_t *
	from now on, which is compatible with unsigned char *.
	No implicit conversion to or from this type, in C or C++.

	* hash.c (make_hash): Convert void * to mem_t *.

	* lib.c (oom_realloc, chk_malloc, chk_realloc, vec_set_fill,
	cobj, init): Convert to using mem_t *.

	* lib.h (mem_t): New typedef.
	(struct cobj): Convert void * to mem_t *.
	(oom_realloc, chk_malloc, chk_realloc, init): Declarations updated.

	* regex.c (regex_compile): Convert void * to mem_t *.

	* stream.c (snarf_line, string_out_put_string, make_stdio_stream,
	make_pipe_stream, make_string_input_stream,
	make_string_byte_input_stream, make_string_output_stream,
	get_string_from_stream): Convert void * to mem_t *.

	* txr.c (oom_realloc_handler): Convert void * to mem_t *.

2009-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* gc.c (heap_min_bound, heap_max_bound): New static globals.
	(more): Update heap_min_bound and heap_max_bound.
	(in_heap): Do early rejection tests on the pointer. If it's
	not aligned, or it's completely outside of the bounding
	box of the heap area, short circuit to false.

2009-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 027.

	Code cleanup.
	
	gc-related bugfix.

	Improved file copying semantics of make install,
	and adherence for DESTDIR convention.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 027.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 027.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 027.

2009-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Better test for g++, when removing
	warning options not appropriate for g++. Sometimes
	g++ may be called something that dosn't end in g++,
	like g++4.

2009-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (YY_NO_UNPUT): Removed superfluous #define. This is not
	needed because suppressing generation of unput is requested via
	the %option. In scanners generated by the legacy version of
	flex, 2.5.4, still widely in use. this redundancy leads to
	a multiple #define YY_NO_UNPUT and a compiler warning.

2009-12-03  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fix for failing test suite on MIPS machine, due to
	gc failing to mark a local variable in txr_main.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Changed from internal linkage to external.
	This prevents gcc -O2 from inlining txr_main into main.
	We need separate stack frames for main and txr_main,
	in order to be sure that when walking to the bottom of
	stack pointer, we visit all locals in main. This is the
	whole reason why there is a separate txr_main.

2009-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (tests): Don't depend on the executable. Otherwise,
	during make install-tests, if it doesn't exist in the
	install directory, a gcc compile command gets deposited
	into the run.sh generated script.
	(install-tests): Fixes to make this work when using
	a separate build directory. Split the cpio -p job
	into a cpio -i piping into cpio -o.

2009-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (install-tests): New target. Provides a way to make the
	test cases part of the installation, and a generated script to run the
	commands on the installation host.

2009-12-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fix annoyances with dependency generation, such as picking up local
	files that are not in the project.

	* Makefile (depend): Rule passes object file names as arguments
	to depend.txr script.

	* depend.txr: Changed to take names of object files from command line,
	rather than scanning the directory for all .c files. Switched
	to new style next directives, using quasiliterals.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2009-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): If the compiler matches the pattern %g++,
	then remove some C-front-end-specific warnings from CFLAGS,
	which the g++ front end will complain about.

2009-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): add -Dlint to CFLAGS when compiling y.tab.o.
	This suppresses some warnings from a byacc-generated parser,
	and gets rid of a useless static sccsid array. May help with
	Bison-generated parser also.

2009-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l: Use flex options to suppress generation of the
	unused functons yyunput and yyinput, thus getting rid of
	some compiler diagnostics.

2009-11-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure: Workaround in banner code for coreutils printf %.*s bug.

2009-11-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Switching to DESTDIR convention for install.
	Make install step does some things more correctly now,
	without relying on the install program.

	* configure: Help text doesn't refer to ``Makefile variables''
	but ``make variables'', or ``variables in config.make''.
	The install_prefix variable becomes DESTDIR now in
	config.make.

	* Make (INSTALL): New rule body macro. 
	(install): Uses of mkdir -p and cp switched to a call
	to the INSTALL macro.

2009-11-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 026.

	Fixed wchar_t build problem in parser.y.

	Improved configure script to auto-detect yacc program.
	Txr works with either Berkeley yacc (byacc) or Bison.

	Fixed some two uninitialized memory bugs.

	Valgrind API is now used to integrate GC memory manager
	with valgrind.

	The symbols nothrow and args in the next directive
	are now keyword symbols, written :nothrow and
	:args.  (Breaks backward compatibility; sorry!)

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 026.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 026.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 026.

2009-11-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Not all systems have a yacc alias for the yacc program. 
	txr is known to work with two yacc implementations: GNU Bison
	and Berkeley yacc. Let's add some auto-detection for yacc.

	* Makefile: use "include" rather than "-include" for
	including config.make, so that make fails if the file does
	not exist.
	(conftest.yacc): New target. Just outputs the value of the
	variable expansion of $(YACC).

	* configure (yaccname): New variable.
	(gen_config_make): New function.
	Steps added to test for existence of various yaccs.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* gc.c (mark_mem_region): Bugfix: do not mess with the valgrind
	accessibility of the heap object if valgrind debugging is not enabled.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (grammar): Fixes for bison 2.4.1. Remove superfluous action
	in chrlit.  Include <stdlib.h> for abort.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Refinements to Valgrind support.

	* gc.c (mark_mem_region): If a pointer from the stack is valid
	for the heap, it may point to a free object, which is marked
	in accessible. We must grant the garbage collector access
	to the object. If the object is free, close off access.
	This is not 100% correct, because if the object is accessible
	but undefined, then we end up flipping it to defined.
	(sweep): Before sweeping each heap, mark the entire block as defined.
	This is necessary because sweep accesses blocks, which may be free,
	and thus inaccessible. Then, during the sweep, any block
	which is already free must be marked inaccessible again.
	This means that the remaining blocks that are reachable become defined.
	Here that is okay, because gc has marked all those blocks. If any
	of them had uninitialized members, that would have been caught
	by valgrind during the marking phase, if not sooner.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	More Valgrind support. New option --vg-debug which turns on
	Valgrind protection of free blocks. This works independently
	of --gc-debug.

	* gc.c (opt_vg_debug): New conditionally defined global variable.
	(more): Mark entire heap of free blocks inaccessible, if
	vg debugging is enabled.
	(make_obj): If vg debugging enabled, mark returned block as accessible,
	but undefined, and take care to grant self temporary access while
	manipulating the free list.
	(finalize): Removed old debugging logic of not freeing strings
	and vectors during gc debug. If the null pointers are ever a problem
	during debugging, they can be checked inside obj_print, and
	turned into #<garbage ...> notation.
	(sweep): Switch to FIFO free block recycling if vg debugging is
	enabled, just like when gc debugging is enabled.
	Mark freed blocks as inaccessible, careful to grant self
	temporary access while manipulating the free list.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Parse the --vg-debug option.

	* txr.h (opt_vg_debug): Conditionally declared.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fix a build breakage that may happen on some platforms.
	The parser.y file includes "utf8.h", which uses the the type wint_t.
	It also includes "lib.h" which uses "wchar_t". But it fails
	to include any headers which define these types.
	The generated y.tab.c picks up wchar_t by the Bison-inserted
	inclusion of <stdlib.h>, so that's how we got that. But wint_t does not
	come from any of the headers---if they are standard-conforming.

	* parser.y: Add inclusion of <stddef.h> and <wchar.h>.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	More valgrind integration. Vector objects keep displaced pointers
	to vector data; they point to element 0 which is actually the third
	element of the vector. If an object is only referenced by interior
	pointers, Valgrind reports it as possibly leaked. This change
	conditionally adds a pointer to the true start of the vector,
	if Valgrind support is enabled.

	* lib.h (struct vec): vec_true_start, new member.

	* lib.c (vector, vec_set_fill):  Maintain vec_true_start.

2009-11-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	First stab at Valgrind integration. First goal: eliminate false
	positives when gc is accessing uninitialized parts of the stack.

	* configure (valgrind): New variable. Defaults to false (do not
	build valgrind support). New check for whether the valgrind API
	is actually avilable if --valgrind is selected.
	(HAVE_VALGRIND): Conditionally added to config.h.

	* gc.c: Conditionally include valgrind memcheck.h header.
	(mark_mem_region): After pulling out a value from the stack,
	mark that copy as defined memory using VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED.
	(mark): Removed check for a registered root variable pointer
	being null; this cannot happen, unless someone registers a
	null pointer, or the stack is trashed. The comment about a
	possible null was misleading.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fix uninitialized memory locations.

	* hash.c (make_hash): Uninitialized h->count member.

	* lib.c (mkustring): Preallocated string buffer to have its
	null terminator byte initialized, because the caller
	does not do so (e.g. see lit_har_helper in parser.y).
	The calling module is responsible for initializing all API-accessible
	parts of the string, but the null belongs to the string implementation.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Switching to keyword symbols for :args and :nothrow.

	* lib.c (args_s, nothrow_s): Renamed to args_k and nothrow_k.
	(flattn_s): Renamed to flatten_s.
	(obj_init): args_k and nothrow_k interned in keyword package.

	* lib.h (args_s, nothrow_s, flattn_s): Declarations updated.

	* match.c (match_files): Follow name changes.

	* tests/004/query1.txr: Changed nothrow to :nothrow.

	* txr.1: Documentation updated.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	/Now/ this can be released as 025.

	utf8.c (utf8_from_uc): Fix bug introduced several commits ago (porting
	to C++). Caught by regression test suite. Found using git bisect.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 025

	External changes:

	Flattening an empty list produces an empty list, not (()),
	which is a list containing an empty list.

	Tightened up semantics of bind, merge and other forms.
	Fixed false positives in binding.

	More bugfixes in the parser leading to garbage error messages.
	(Still no regression test cases for error cases, oops).

	Fixed crash in regexp function.

	Symbol packages added. Keyword symbols (symbols in keyword package)
	introduced.

	Clarified semantics that t, nil and keywords evaluate to themselves.

	Fixed bugs in the system for building in a separate directory.

	Configuration script now tests the compiler for sanity, and runs
	compiler-based tests to detects which integer type to use for casting
	an obj_t * value to a number, and what specifiers to use for
	inline functions.

	Internal changes:
	
	Macros replaced with inline functions.

	Uses of obj_t * replaced with val typedef everywhere.

	Exceptions occuring during early initialization no longer
	lead to an infinite recursion due to streams not working.

	The long type is no longer used, but a configured typedef.

	Configure script now spits out a "config.h" header that is
	widely included.

	Symbol globals renamed to _s naming scheme.

	Code made portable to C++. A new configure flag --ccname make it easier
	to switch compilers.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 025.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 025.

	* configure: Bumped txr_ver to 025.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Auto-detect what specifiers to use for inline functions.
	Allow compiler command to be set independently of full path
	for easier compiler switching.

	* Makefile (conftest.o): Target removed. What this rule does
	is already an implicit rule; and nowhere else in the Makefile
	are there rules for .c -> .o.
	(conftest2): New target, for two-translation-unit config test program.
	(INLINE_FLAGS): Removed.

	* configure (ccname, inline): New variables.
	(inline_flags): Variable removed. INLINE_FLAGS not generated
	any more in config.make.  Added test for what inline specifiers to use,
	which is turned into #define INLINE ... in the config.h header.

	* lib.h: (tag, is_ptr, is_num, is_chr, is_lit, type, auto_str,
	static_str, litptr): Changed from inline to INLINE.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Changes to make the code portable to C++ compilers, which
	can be taken advantage of for better diagnostics.

	* gc.c (more, mark_obj, sweep, unmark): Obey stricter C++ rules
	with regard to enumerations. 
	(make_obj): Avoid using C++ keyword "try".

	* lib.c: Removed duplicate definitions of objects, found by C++.
	(chk_malloc, chk_realloc): Casts needed when converting from void *.
	(list): Discovered and fixed lack of va_end.
	(trim_str, acons_new_l): Avoid use of C++ keyword "new".
	(make_sym): Follow rename of struct member.

	* lib.h (struct sym): Renamed val member to value.
	(null): Added missing declaration.

	* match.c (enum fpip_close, struct fpip): Moved and named enum out of
	struct.

	* regex.c (L0_full): Cast added in signed/unsigned comparison.
	(L1_fill_range, L2_fill_range, L3_fill_range, char_set_create):
	Don't mark static blank structures const; then they need initializers
	in C++.
	(char_set_compl, char-set_destroy, char_set_contains, nfa_compile_set):
	Avoid using the C++ keyword "compl".

	* regex.h (struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set, struct
	displaced_char_set, struct large_char_set, struct xlarge_char_set):
	Renamed compl member to comp.

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc, ut8_decode): Obey stricter C++ rules
	with regard to enumerations.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fixed broken yyerrorf. It was still taking char *, and passing
	that as an object to vformat, resulting in #<garbage: ...>
	output.

	* parser.h (yybadtoken): Declaration updated.

	* parser.l (yybadtoken): Redefined to take val argument.
	The tok stays as int; this is closely coupled to yacc,
	so why bother with num().

	* parser.y (grammar): Fix occurences of yybadtoken to pass
	proper literal objects using the lit macro, or nil in
	the one case when there is no context.

2009-11-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Renaming global variables that denote symbols, such that they
	have a _s suffix.

	* lib.c (cons_t, str_t, chr_t, num_t, sym_t, pkg_t, fun_t, vec_t,

	internal_error_s, numeric_error_s, range_error_s, query_error_s,
	file_error_s, process_error_s,
	(code2type, typeof, make_package, intern, obj_init): Symbols
	references follow rename.

	* lib.h (cons_t, str_t, chr_t, num_t, sym_t, pkg_t, fun_t, vec_t,
	stream_t, hash_t, lcons_t, lstr_t, cobj_t var, regex, set, cset, wild,

	nothrow, throw, defex error, type_error, internal_err, numeric_err,
	range_err query_error, file_error, process_error): Declarations
	updated.

	* hash.c (make_hash): Symbol references follow rename.

	* match.c (sem_error, file_err, dump_var, match_line, subst_vars,
	eval_form, complex_stream, extract_vars, do_output_line, do_output,
	match_files): Likewise.

	* parser.y (grammar, repeat_rep_helper, define_transform): Likewise.

	* unwind.h (internal_error, numeric_assert, range_bug_unless);
	Likewise.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure (platform_flags, remove_flags): New config variables.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Take into account new flags.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Follow up on 64 bit compilation warnings.

	* lib.c (chr, chrp): Do not convert directly between wchar_t and
	the pointer type; go through cnum intermediate value.

	* stream.c (vformat): Fix bad cast from pointer to int; this was
	missed in the conversion to cnum because it should have been a
	cast to long originally.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (conftest.o): revert change that took CFLAGS from
	this target.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure: Don't rely on higher precision arithmetic from the build
	machine's shell. POSIX requires shell arithmetic to be only signed
	long. We can't compute the INT_PTR_MAX constant in the shell, but
	rather generate a constant C expression to compute it.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Reporting of compile errors during configuration for easier
	configure debugging.

	* Makefile (conftest): Pass all of the CFLAGS when building
	conftest. This way bad compiler options are caught
	right in the basic compiler sanity test.

	* configure: Compiler jobs are redirected to temporary error
	file conftest.err which is dumped if there is a failure.
	Parting text is improved: the user should not blindly
	trust the success of the configuration but check its sanity.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure: Bugfix in parsing configuration variables
	which contain the = character.

	* Makefile (conftest.o): Pass full CFLAGS to configuration test
	builds. If some flags don't work with the compiler, this should
	be caught.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Added -I. so current directory is first
	in the include search path. This is needed for finding
	generated header files, when building in a separate directory.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (chk_malloc, chk_realloc): Fix diagnosable conversion,
	caught by gcc 4.1.1.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure (cross): Print out value of $cross in --help.

	* depend.txr: Add "config.h" to list of headers that are not
	prefixed with $(top_srcdir).

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2009-11-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Improving portability. It is no longer assumed that pointers
	can be converted to a type long and vice versa. The configure
	script tries to detect the appropriate type to use. Also,
	some run-time checking is performed in the streams module
	to detect which conversions specifier strings to use for
	printing numbers.

	* Makefile (conftest, conftest.o, conftest.syms): New targets.
	Used by the configure script. 

	* configure (intptr, nm): New configuration variables.
	Generating config.make is no longer the last step; compiler tests are
	performed after config.make is set up, so that rules in the Makefile
	can be used for doing the compiling. (This is the cleanest way to do
	it, since the paths to the tools may contain Make variable expansion
	syntax).  New steps are added to try to detect whether the compiler has
	a wider integer type than the c89 long, and which of the available
	types (including, potentially, the extra wide type) is suitable for
	holding a pointer. Results are generated into a header config.h.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

	* lib.h (NUM_MAX, NUM_MIN): Now derived from INT_PTR_MAX and
	INT_PTR_MIN macros, which come from config.h.
	(cnum): New typedef name.
	(cobj ops, tag, auto_str, static_str, litptr, lit_noex):
	Changed long to cnum.
	(num, c_num): Declaration updated.

	* lib.c (equal, length, num, c_num, plus, minus, neg, search_str,
	cat_str, vector, vec_set_fill, obj_print, obj_pprint): Changed
	long to cnum.

	* gc.c (mark_obj): Changed long to cnum.

	* hash.c (stuct hash, ll_hash, hash_mark, hash_grow,
	hash_process_weak): Changed long to cnum.

	* match.c (complex_open, do_output_line, do_output, match_files):
	Changed long to cnum.

	* parser.h (lineno): Declaration updated.

	* parser.l (lineno): Redefined as cnum.
	(grammar): Changed long to cnum.

	* parser.y (%union/yystype): num member changed to cnum.
	of config.h added.

	* regex.c (nfa_run, nfa_machine_match_span, search_regex):
	Changed long to cnum.

	* regex.h (struct nfa_machine): Members last_accept_pos and count
	changed to cnum.
	(nfa_run, nfa_machine_match_span): Declarations updated.

	* stream.c (struct fmt): New type.
	(fmt_tab): New static array.
	(num_fmt): New static pointer.
	(detect_format_string): New function.
	(vformat): Changed long to cnum. Formatting of numbers uses
	num_fmt.
	(stream_init): Call detect_format_string.

	* txr.c, unwind.c, utf8.c: include config.h.

	* unwind.h (internal_error): Local declaration of num updated.

2009-11-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Introducing symbol packages. Internal symbols are now in
	a system package instead of being hacked with the $ prefix.
	Keyword symbols are provided. In the matcher, evaluation
	is tightened up. Keywords, nil and t are not bindeable, and
	errors are thrown if attempts are made to bind them.
	Destructuring in dest_bind is strict in the number of items.
	String streams are exploited to print bindings to objects
	that are not strings or characters. Numerous bugfixes.

	* lib.h (enum type, type_t): new member: PKG.
	(struct stym): New member: package.
	(struct package): New type.
	(union obj, obj_t): New member pk.
	(interned_syms): Declaration removed.
	(keyword_package, pkg_t): Declared.
	(intern, acons_new_l): Declarations updated.
	(find_package, symbol_package, keywordp): Declared.

	* lib.c (interned_syms): Definition removed.
	(packages, pkg_t, system_package, keyword_package, user_package): New
	global variables.
	(code2type, equal, obj_pprint): Handle PKG case.
	(symbol_package, make_package, find_package, keywordp): New functions.
	(make_sym): Initialize package field of symbol.
	(intern): Takes package argument. Rewritten using packages,
	which use hash tables to store symbols.
	(acons_new_l): Takes extra pointer argument to return an extra
	value.
	(obj_init): Updated to handle packages. The orders of some
	initializations have to change. The way nil is added as a symbol is
	quite different, and a special hack for the symbol t is used.
	Most symbols go into the user_package, but symbols that were
	previously namespaced with $ go to the system package.
	(obj_print): SYM cases now considers the packge of a symbol.
	Symbols in the user package are printed as before.
	Symbols with no package are printed using #: notation;
	keywords with : notation; and all others with their package prefix.
	PKG case is handled.

	* gc.c (finalize): Handle PKG case.
	(mark_obj): For SYM, mark the new package member. Handle PKG case.

	* hash.h (gethash_l): Declaration updated.

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Handle PKG case.
	(gethash_l): Extra argument added to distinguish new addition
	from existing find.

	* match.c (dump_var): Dumps any object now by printing to
	a string with a string stream.
	(bindable): New function.
	(dest_bind): Tightened up to distinguish bindable symbols
	from non-bindable. Symbols that stand for themselves, including nil,
	can only match themselves. Destructuring matches have to
	match in the number of elements: dot notation can be used
	to match superfluous elements.
	(eval_form): Tightened up to recognize bindable symbols.
	(match_files): Various directives honor non-bindable symbols (cat,
	merge, flatten).

	* parser.l (yybadtoken): Handle KEYWORD case.
	(grammar): TOK can start with : . Returned as KEYWORD terminal,
	with a lexeme that no longer has the : character.

	* parser.y (KEYWORD): New nonterminal.
	(grammar): Calls to intern given extra parameter.
	In the expr rule, KEYWORD turned into symbol in keyword package.

	* regex.c (regexp): Bugfix: dereferencing non pointer.

	* stream.c (vformat): Bugfixes in state machine: handling
	of prefix digits; printing of numbers in ~s. 

	* txr.c (txr_main): Intern calls updated.

	* txr.1: Updated with information about nil, t and keywords.
	More details about destructuring matching in bind.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* unwind.c (uw_throw): If streams are not initialized,
	we have an unhandled exception too early in initialization.
	Use C stream to print an error message and abort.
	Using the nil stream variable will just cause a recursion bomb.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (intern): Symbol interning to hash tables.
	(obj_init): interned_syms must be created as a hash
	table. Rearranged the order of some initializations so
	the vector code called by hash works.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (dest_bind): Fix breakage from two commits ago;
	was falling through to unsuccessful return in the
	consp case.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (grammar): Fix error actions that do not assign
	a value to $$.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (dest_bind): Extended to handle more general forms
	by using eval_form rather than direct symbol binding lookups.
	False positive return fixed.
	(match_line): Fixed merge to use eval_from
	rather than direct symbol binding.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (flatten): Semantics change. The flatten function
	should not map nil -> (nil), but nil -> nil.

2009-11-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Changing ``obj_t *'' occurences to a ``val'' typedef. (Ideally,
	we wouldn't have to declare object variables at all, so why
	use an obtuse syntax to do so?)

	* lib.h (val): New typedef name. Used throughout.

	* gc.c, gc.h, hash.c, hash.h, lib.c, match.c, match.h, parser.h,
	parser.l, parser.y, regex.c, regex.h stream.c,, stream.h, txr.c,
	unwind.c, unwind.h: Replace obj_t * with val almost everywhere.
	Low-level gc functinos that work with arrays of obj_t use
	obj_t *. Seeing pointer arithmetic on a val doesn't make sense.
	In macros we use obj_t *, to reduce the chances of clashing
	with some local variable called val.

2009-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fixed mangled formatting of exception handling example.

2009-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Get rid of macros in favor of safer inline functions. 

	The recent auto_str("byte str") error could have been caught
	at compile time.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Include expansion of INLINE_FLAGS.

	* configure (inline_flags): New variable.
	(INLINE_FLAGS): New variable generated in config.make.

	* lib.h (tag, is_ptr, is_num, is_chr, is_lit, type,
	auto_str, static_str, litptr): Function-like macros converted to
	functions.

2009-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 024

	Fixed show-stopper breakage in parse error diagnostic function.

	Fixed bug introduced back in 015: collects that don't yield
	any variable bindings being wrongly treated as failed.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 024.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 024.

2009-11-19  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Use unsigned char * as allocator return value.

	* lib.c (chk_malloc, chk_realloc): Return unsigned char *.

	* lib.c (chk_malloc, chk_realloc): Declarations updated.

	* utf8 (utf8_dup_to_uc): Remove cast to unsigned char *.

2009-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Following-up on diagnostics obtained by running code through C++
	compiler. Idea: allocator functions return char * instead of void *,
	like malloc did in classic pre-ANSI C. That way we are forced to 
	use a cast except when the target pointer is char * already.

	* lib.c (progname): Duplicate definition of global removed.
	(equal): Some default: cases to switch statements added.
	(chk_malloc): Returns char *.
	(chk_realloc): Returns char *, but takes void * on the way in.
	That way we get C++-like behavior.
	(chk_strdup): Oops, this returned void * instead of wchar_t *.
	c++ catches boo boo.
	(stringp): Added default: case to switch.
	(vec_set_fill): Cast return value of chk_realloc.

	* lib.h (chk_malloc, chk_realloc, chk_strdup): Declarations updated.

	* parser.h (lineno): extern qualifier added to prevent duplicate
	definitions of.

	* regex.c (nfa_free, nfa_run, nfa_machine_init, regex_compile): Cast
	return value of chk_malloc.

	* stream.c (snarf_line, get_string_from_stream): Cast return value of
	chk_realloc.

2009-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_line, match_files): Fix broken behavior of collect
	that doesn't match anything. It is not a failed match, as the
	documentation makes perfectly clear.  Collect/coll were introduced
	in txr-006 and had the proper non-failing semantics.
	However, in txr-015, during code restructuring, a bug crept in.
	When changing to a different debugiging function, for some reason
	I added the nil returns.

2009-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (yyerror): Total breakage: can't take auto_str of char *
	string. 
	(yyerrorf): Total breakage: arguments of wrong types. Detected
	by vformat as garbage.

2009-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	txr.1: Clarified handling of UTF-8, now that it's precise and portable.

2009-11-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 023

	Minor bugfix.

	Code cleanup. Portability.

	Completely removed dependency on C99 wide character stream functions,
	and character encoding support from glibc. All UTF-8 encoding
	and decoding is done by the program itself.

	Removed the use of all GNU extensions and C99 syntax.

	txr now requires a C90 compiler, and POSIX 1003.1 and 1003.2.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 023.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 023.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	More removal of C99 wide character I/O, and tightening up
	of standard conformance.

	* configure (lang_flags): Specify -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=2 to obtain
	POSIX 1003.1 and POSIX 1003.2 functions from the headers,
	without GNU extensions. Specify -std=c89 to get C89 conformance
	from gcc. 

	* match.c (dump_byte_string): New function.
	(dump_shell_string): Retargetted to object streams.
	(dump_var, dump_bindings): Retargetted to object streams.
	Changed back to using a byte string for the array index prefixes,
	to avoid using the wide-character swprintf.

	* parser.l (grammar): Eliminate wcsdup uses in favor of chk_strdup.
	Not only is wcsdup a GNU extension, it doesn't have the OOM check.

	* stream.c: Added <sys/wait.h> header to define WIFEXITED and others.

	* txr.c: Added include of <stdarg.h>. Removed <locale.h>,
	(main): Removed setlocale call. Not needed any more, since wide
	stream and string I/O is no longer used from the C library.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Removing use of C99 wide character I/O.

	* stream.c (BROKEN_POPEN_GETWC): Macro removed. Work around no
	longer needed since the program does not call getwc.
	(struct stdio_handle): #ifdef text removed.
	New member added: utf8 decoder.
	(stdio_maybe_read_error, stdio_maybe_write_error): Treat
	null handle as an exception rather than nil return. No need
	to check ferror in stdio_maybe_write_error, since there is no
	need to distinguish an end-of-file situation from error.
	(stdio_put_char_callback, stdio_get_char_callback): New functions.
	(stdio_put_string, stdio_put_char): Retargetted to utf8 encoder.
	Null handle treated as separate kind of error.
	(snarf_line, stdio_get_line, stdio_get_char): Retargetted to utf8
	decoder.
	(pipe_close): #ifdef text removed.
	(make_stdio_stream): utf8 decode initialized.
	(make_pipe_stream): utf8 decoder initialized. #ifdef text removed.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Warning fixes.

	* hash.c (hash_ops): Add missing initializer.

	* match.c (complex_open): Add missing intializer to ret variable.

	* regex.c (regex_obj_ops): Add missing initializer.

	* stream.c (stdio_ops, pipe_ops, string_in_ops, byte_in_ops,
	string_out_ops, dir_ops): Likewise.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (chrp): Fix broken is_chr(num) call.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* regex.c (nfa_all_states, nfa_closure): visited parameter
	should be unsigned.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fixes for compliance to C89.

	* lib.c (init): Do not define variable after statements.

	* match.c (match_files): Likewise.

	* regex.h (struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set, struct
	displaced_char_set, struct large_char_set,
	struct xlarge_char_set): do not use enum bitfields, which is a GCC
	extension.

	* unwind.h (enum uw_frtype, uw_frtype_t): Combine into one
	declartion, eliminating forward enum reference which is a GCC
	extension.
	(uw_block_begin): Add dummy typedef to macro so that it requires
	a following semicolon. Without this, if the macro use is followed
	by a semicolon, that semicolon looks like a null statement. A
	subsequent declaration thus follows a statement and is not conforming
	to C89. Also added an opening do.
	(uw_block_end): Add while(0) to match do in uw_block_begin.
	(uw_env_begin, uw_env_end): Add do/while(0) to macro pair, so
	uw_env_end reuqires a semicolon.
	(uw_catch_begin, uw_catch_end): Likewise.

2009-11-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 022

	Fix for bug 28033: crash in string output stream.
	(Used by exception handling).

	New kernel object type introduced which allows C string literals
	to be used as first-class objects.

	Use of printf-like C formatting eliminated from the code base.

	The dependency on C99 wide character I/O is now minimized.

	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 022.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 022.

2009-11-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (rebuild): New target. Tired of doing make clean; make.

2009-11-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Big round of changes to switch the code base to use the stream
	abstraction instead of directly using C standard I/O,
	to eliminate most uses of C formatted I/O,
	and fix numerous bugs, such variadic argument lists which
	lack a terminating ``nao'' sentinel. 
	
	Bug 28033 is addressed by this patch, since streams no longer provide
	printf-compatible formatting. The native formatter is extended with
	some additional capabilities to take over.

	The work on literal objects is expanded and they are now used
	throughout the code base.

	Fixed bad realloc in string output stream: reallocating by number
	of wide chars rather than bytes.

	* gc.c (sweep): Debugging code switched from fprintf to format.

	* lib.c (typ_check, type_check2, car, cdr, car_l, cdr_l, list,
	num, chrp, apply, cobj_print_op, dump): Retargetted, with help of new
	literals, to new funtions that take string objects, rather than raw C
	strings.
	(obj_print, obj_pprint): Revamped with support for LIT type.
	Retargetted to not use C style I/O functions in streams.

	* lib.h (lit): Macro retargetted to another macro so that it expands
	its argument.
	(lit_noex): New macro, like lit, but does not macro-expand argument.
	(auto_str): New macro.
	(static_str): New macro.

	* match.c (debugf, debuglf, sem_error, file_err): Converted from C
	string to string object.
	(dest_bind, match_line, LOG_MISMATCH, LOG_MATCH, match_files):
	Retargetted to new interfaces that take string objects rather than raw
	C strings.
	(complex_stream): New function.
	(do_output_line, do_output, extract): Retargetted from C streams to
	object streams.	

	* parser.h (yyerrorf): Declaration updated.

	* parser.l (yyerror): Call new yyerrorf interface, using auto_str
	macro to dress up C string as a temporary object.
	(yyerrorf): Changed from C strings to object strings.	
	(yybadtoken, grammar): Retargetted to new yyerrorf.

	* stream.c (strm_ops): put_string and put_char function pointers
	changed to take object strings rather than C strings.  vcformat and
	vformat virtuals removed. C formatting is not supported, and vformat is
	handled above the stream switch level in one place for all streams.
	(common_vformat, stdio_vcformat, string_out_vcformat, cformat,
	put_cstring, put_cchar): Functions removed.	
	(stdio_stream_print, stdio_stream_destroy, stdio_maybe_write_error,
	stdio_put_string, stdio_put_char, stdio_close, pipe_close,
	string_out_put_char, make_pipe_stream, make_string_input_stream,
	make_string_output_stream, make_dir_stream, close_stream,
	get_line, put_line, get_char, put_char, put_string): Retargetted to new
	string object interfaces.
	(stdio_ops, pipe_ops): stdio_vcformat and common_vcformat initializers
	(string_out_ops): string_out_vcformat and common_vcformat initializers
	removed.
	(string_in_ops, byte_in_ops, dir_ops): Two null initializers removed.
	(string_out_put_string): Converted to object string interface.
	Unnecessary chk_realloc call suppressed.
	(get_string_from_stream): Fixed bad call to realloc with incorrect
	size.
	(vformat_num, vformat_str): New functions, helper to vformat.
	(vformat): Rewritten. Is now the formatting engine.
	(format, put_string, put_char): Interface converted from C string to
	object string.

	* stream.h (vformat, format): Declarations updated.
	(vcformat, cformat, put_cstring, put_cchar): Declarations removed.

	* txr.c (oom_realloc_handler, help, txr_main): Retargetted to object
	stream and strings.

	* unwind.c (uw_throw, type_mismatch, uw_register_subtype): Retargetted
	to new string object interfaces.
	(uw_throwf, uw_errorf): Interface changed from C string to object
	string.
	(uw_throwcf, uw_errorcf): Functions removed.

	* unwind.h (uw_throwf, uw_errorf, type_mismatch): Declarations updated.
	(uw_throwcf, uw_errorcf): Declarations removed.
	(internal_error): Macro interface changed and retargetted to
	object strings. Also, num hygiene problem worked around with local
	extern declaration.
	(numeric_assert, range_bug_unless): Retargetted to object strings.

	* utf8.c (utf8_to, utf8_dup_from_uc, utf8_dup_from,
	utf8_dup_to_uc): Casts of chk_malloc return value added.

2009-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Use the 11 tag bit pattern to denote a new type: LIT. This is a
	pointer to a C static string, intended for literals. We can now
	treat literal strings as light-weight objects.

	* lib.h (TAG_MASK): Ensure the constant expr has long type.
	(TAG_LIT): New macro.
	(enum type, type_t): New enum member, LIT.

	* gc.c (finalize, mark_obj): Handle LIT type.

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Likewise.

	* lib.c (code2type, equal, stringp, length_str, c_str,
	obj_print): Likewise.
	(obj_init): Intern symbols using literal strings.
	(type): Parentheses added to macro expansion.
	(is_lit, lit, litptr): New macros.

2009-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (chr): Take wchar_t argument, not int. Dropped range check.
	(c_chr): Return wchar_t not int.

	* lib.h (chr, c_chr): Declarations updated.
	
2009-11-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 021.

	Text is represented using wide characters now. Queries and data
	are parsed as UTF-8, so extended characters can be directly used.
	Numeric character escapes can go up to \x10FFF.  (More limited on
	platforms where wchar_t is 16 bit).  Regular expressions support
	extended characters, directly or through escapes. Regex character set
	matches can use full Unicode range.  New test case 005 exercises
	some of these features over Japanese text.

	Failed exit status of pipes, and file close errors are exceptions now.

	Bug fixed in regex character classes.

	Fixed off-by-one error in lazy string implementation, which broke
	some uses of the @(freeform) directive.

	Fixed all instances of gc bug 28086: objects being prematurely
	reclaimed.  This showed up when compiling for profiling (gcc -pg).

	The --cc argument of the configure script works properly now.

	Numbers and characters are unboxed types now, encoded directly in
	the (obj_t *) value. Lowest two bits of (obj_t *) are a tag
	distinguishing characters, integers and pointers.  The program
	performs better from not having to cons memory when operating
	on numbers and characters.

	Discovered bug in glibc: getwc function segfaults when applied to
	stream returned by popen. Worked around this bug. Bug is filed
	as 10958 in glibc bugzilla.

	Internals: 
	
	Hash tables implemented. Hash tables support weak keys and values.

	* configure, hash.c, lib.c, stream.c, utf8.c: Removed trailing
	from some lines.
	
	* txr.c (version): Bumped to 021. Removed trailing whitespace.

	* txr.1: Bumped version to 021.

2009-11-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Provide both char * and unsigned char * interfaces in UTF-8 module.
	Fix unsigned and plan char * mixing.

	* utf8.c (utf8_from_uc, utf8_to_uc, utf8_dup_from_uc,
	utf8_dup_to_uc): New functions.
	(utf8_from): Fix type of backtrack pointer to unsigned char *.

	* utf8.h (utf8_from_uc, utf8_to_uc, utf8_dup_from_uc,
	utf8_dup_to_uc): Declared.

	* lib.c (string_utf8): Changed to take char * argument.
	
	* lib.h (string_utf8): Declaration updated.

2009-11-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (depend): Marked phony and $(PROG) prerequisite dropped. 
	(clean, distclean, tests, install): Phony targets marked phony.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2009-11-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* configure (cc): Compute variable properly.

2009-11-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fixes for bug 28086. When constructing a cobj, whose associated
	C structure contains obj_t * references, we should initialize
	that C structure after allocating the cobj. If we initialize
	the structure first, it may end up having the /only/ references
	to the objects. In that case, the objects are invisible to the
	garbage collector. The subsquent allocation of the cobj itself
	then may invoke gc which will turn these objects into dust.
	The result is a cobj which contains a handle structure that
	contains references to free objects. The fix is to allocate
	the handle structure, then the cobj which is associated with
	that handle, and then initialize the handle, at which point it
	is okay if the handle has the only references to some objects.
	Care must be taken not to let a cobj escape with a partially
	initialized handle structure, and not to trigger gc between
	allocating the cobj, and initializing the fields.

	* hash.c (make_hash): Fix cobj construction order.

	* stream.c (make_stdio_stream): Fix cobj construction order.
	(make_pipe_stream): Fix cobj construction order. Also
	noticed and fixed a bug: h->descr field not being initialized
	in the currently enabled BROKEN_POPEN_GETWC variant of the code.

2009-11-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New testcase which does some UTF-8 scanning, Unicode regexes,
	and @(freeform).

	* tests/005/data: New UTF-8 file.

	* tests/005/query-1.txr: Likewise.

	* tests/005/query-1.expected: Likewise.

	* Makefile (TXR_ARGS): New target-specific assignment to set
	data for test case set 005.

2009-11-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (symbolp): Bugfix: function crashed on NUM argument.
	(lazy_str): Fix for gc correctness: object from make_obj must be
	completely intialized before any gc-triggering operation is invoked,
	otherwise the garbage collector will be traversing an object
	whose fields contain old garbage.
	(lazy_str_force_upto): Off-by-one error. To force the object
	up to index position N, means forcing up to length N+1.
	This bug can make it look like a lazy string is much shorter
	than it really is.

2009-11-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Allow -c scripts to not have a trailing newline.
	Test suite exercises -c now.

	txr.c (txr_main): If the script specified with -c is not terminated
	by a newline, just add a newline. On the shell command line, it's a
	nuisance to have to add the extra line before closing the quote. 
	It's also awkward in scripting, because the shell (or at
	least Bash 3.0) does not produce a final terminating newline in command
	substitution syntax like -c "$(cat file)". The last newline in
	the file is trimmed, and has to be explicitly added in the script
	itself, which is wrong in the case when the file is empty.

	Makefile (TXR_SCRIPT_ON_CMDLINE): New target-specific variable,
	arbitarily set for test 002.
	(%.ok: %.txr): Rule updated to honor TXR_SCRIPT_ON_CMDLINE
	variable, passing the script body to txr using -c rather than
	as a file argument.

	txr.1: Document -c change.

2009-11-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Previous commit broke UTF-8 lexing, by changing the get_char
	semantics on the input stream to wide character input.
	Also, reading a query the command line (-c) must
	read bytes from a UTF-8 encoding of the string.
	We introduce a new get_byte function which can extract bytes
	from streams which provide it.

	* parser.l (YYINPUT): Call get_byte instead of get_char.

	* stream.c (struct strm_ops): New function pointer, get_byte.
	(stdio_get_byte): New function.
	(stdio_ops, pipe_ops): Add new function.
	(string_in_ops, string_out_ops, dir_ops): Null pointer added.
	(struct byte_input): New struct type.
	(byte_in_get_byte): New function.
	(byte_in_ops): New structure.
	(make_string_byte_input_stream, get_byte): New functions.

	* stream.h (make_string_byte_input_stream, get_byte): New functions.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Make a byte input stream from the command
	line spec, rather than a string input stream.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Continuing wchar_t conversion. Making sure all stdio calls
	use wide character functions so that there is no illicit
	mixing. (But the goal is to replace this usage with txr streams).

	* lib.c (list, cobj_print_op, obj_print, obj_pprint): Use
	wide string literals and I/O functions.

	* match.c (debuglcf): Converted to wchar_t.
	(dump_bindings, match_line, match_lines, extract): Use wide string
	literal and I/O function.

	* parser.h (yyerrorf): Declaration updated.

	* parser.l (yyerror): Use wide-string yyerrorf. Users of
	yyerror continue to pass multibyte strings.
	(yyerrorf): Converted to wchar_t.
	(yybadtoken, grammar): Use wide string literals to call yyerrorf.

	* stream.c (struct strm_ops): vcformat changed to wchar_t.
	(stdio_vcformat, string_out_vcformat, vcformat, cformat): Likewise.

	* stream.h (vformat, vcformat, cformat): Declarations updated.

	* txr.c (oom_realloc_handler, help, hint, txr_main): Use wide string
	literals and I/O functions.

	* unwind.c (uw_throwcf, uw_errorcf): Converted to wchar_t.

	* unwind.h (uw_throwcf, uw_errorcf): Declarations updated.
	(internal_error, numeric_assert, range_bug_unless): Macros
	fixed to use wide string literals.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* utf8.c (utf8_from): Fix total breakage.
	Was writing out incomplete wide characters on internal
	state transtions while traversing a single multi-byte character.
	Also, improved handling of bad bytes close to EOF: if EOF
	occurs in a multi-byte character, it will backtrack,
	and skip one bad byte, etc.
	(utf8_encode, utf8_decoder_init, utf8_decode): New functions.

	* utf8.h (enum utf8_state): New enum.
	(struct utf8_decoder, utf8_decoder_t): New struct.
	(utf8_encode, utf8_decoder_init, utf8_decode): Declared.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Documenting extended characters in man page.
	Cleaned up some more issues related to extended characters.

	* parser.l (grammar): Added error sctions for invalid UTF-8 bytes.

	* stream.c (BROKEN_POPEN_GETWC): New macro. Enables workaround
	for a glibc bug, whereby getwc blows up when applied to a FILE *
	stream returned from a popen call.
	(struct strm_ops): put_char function takes wchar_t.
	(common_format): Use wchar_t rather than int.
	(stdio_put_string): fputws returns -1, not EOF.
	(stdio_put_char, put_cchar): Character argument changed to wchar_t.
	Output done with putwc used instead of putc.
	(snarf_line, stdio_get_char): Use getwc to read from the stream.
	(pipe_close, make_pipe_stream): Implement workaround form glibc bug.

	* stream.h (put_cchar): Declaration updated.

	* txr.1: Added notes about international characters.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Regular expression module updated to do unicode character sets.
	Most of the changes are in the area of representing sets.

	Also, a bug was found in the compilation of regex character sets:
	ranges straddling two adjacent blocks of 32 characters were
	not being added to the character set. However, ranges falling
	within a single 32 block, or spanning three or more such blocks,
	worked properly. This bug is not tickled by common ranges
	such as A-Z, or 0-9, which land within a 32 block.

	* regex.h (BITCELL_LIT): Macro removed.
	(CHAR_SET_SIZE): Macro does not depend on UCHAR_MAX any more,
	but hard-codes a set size of 256. UCHAR_MAX means nothing to us any
	more since we are using wchar_t. The number 256 is simply an
	arbitrarily chosen size for representing the small character
	sets (or the leaves of the radix tree for representing large sets).
	(chset_type_t): New enum typedef.
	(cset_L0_t, cset_L1_t, cset_L2_t, cset_L3_t): New array typedefs.
	(struct char_set): Replaced by union char_set.
	(struct any_char_set, struct small_char_set, struct displaced_char_set,
	struct large_char_set, struct xlarge_char_set): New struct types.
	(char_set_clear): Declaration removed.
	(char_set_create, char_set_destroy): Declared.
	(char_set_add, char_set_add_range, char_set_contains,
	nfa_state_single, nfa_state_set, nfa_machine_feed): Declarations
	updated for wchar_t.
	(struct nfa_state_single): member ch changed to wchar_t.

	* regex.c (char_set_clear): Function removed.
	(CHAR_SET_L0, CHAR_SET_L1, CHAR_SET_L2, CHAR_SET_L3, CHAR_SET_L2_L0,
	CHAR_SET_L2_HI, CHAR_SET_L1_L0, CHAR_SET_L1_HI, CHAR_SET_L0_L0,
	CHAR_SET_L0_HI): New macros.
	(L0_full, L0_fill_range, L0_contains, L1_full, L1_fill_range,
	L1_contains, L1_free, L2_full, L2_fill_range, L2_contains,
	L2_free, L3_fill_range, L3_contains, char_set_create,
	char_set_destroy): New functions.
	(char_set_compl): Works using a flag rather than by actually
	computing a complemented set. Also, is no longer a toggle (and
	was never used that way).
	(char_set_add, char_set_add_range, char_set_contains): Polymorphic over
	the different set types.
	(nfa_state_single, nfa_move, nfa_run, nfa_machine_feed): Converted
	to wchar_t.
	(nfa_state_free): Use char_set_destroy to free set.
	(nfa_state_set): Does not construct the set internally but
	takes it as a parameter.
	(nfa_compile_set): Rewritten to perform two passes over the
	s-expression representing the list of characters and ranges
	making up the set.  The first pass determines what representation
	will be used for the set. The second pass stuffs the characters and
	ranges into the set.

2009-11-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.c (main): call setlocale to set the LC_CTYPE to en_US.UTF-8,
	so that the C library streams do the encoding. Once the program
	is weaned from C library wide character stream I/O, this can go away.

2009-11-11  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Big conversion to wide characters and UTF-8 support.
	This is incomplete. There are too many dependencies on
	wide character support from the C stream I/O library.
	The regex code does not handle wide characters properly.
	Character type is still int in some places, rather than wchar_t.
	Test suite passes though.

	* hash.c (hash_str): Converted to wchar_t.

	* lib.c (progname, type_check, type_check2, type_check3,
	car, cdr, car_l, cdr_l, equal, chk_strdup, string_own,
	string, mkstring, mkustring, init_str, length_str,
	c_str, search_str, sub_str, cat_str, split_str, trim_str,
	chrp, apply, lazy_str, lazy_str_get_trailing_list,
	cobj, obj_init, obj_print, obj_pprint, init): Converted to wchar_t.
	(vector): Cast of chk_malloc return value added.
	(string_utf8): New function.

	* lib.h (struct string): Member str changed to wchar_t *.
	(progname, chk_strdup, string_own, string, init_str,
	c_str, init): Declarations updated.
	(string_utf8): Declared.

	* match.c (debugf, debuglf, sem_error, file_err, dump_shell_string,
	dump_var, dump_bindings, dest_bind, match_line, do_output_line,
	do_output, match_files): Converted to wchar_t.

	* parser.h (spec_file): Declaration updated.

	* parser.l (yy_errorf, char_esc, num_esc): Converted to wchar_t.
	(ASC, ASCN, U, U2, U3, U4, UANY, UNANN, UONLY): New named
	regexes, used for lexing utf-8.
	(grammar): Converted to wchar_t and utf-8 handling.

	* parser.y (%union/yystype): lexeme member changed to wchar_t *,
	chr member changed to wchar_t.

	* regex.c (nfa_run): Input string is wchar_t *.
	(search_regex): String from haystack is wchar_t *.

	* regex.h (nfa_run): Declaration updated.

	* stream.c (struct strm_ops, common_vformat, stdio_stream_print,
	stdio_maybe_read_error, stdio_maybe_write_error, stdio_put_string,
	stdio_put_char, snarf_line, stdio_get_line, stdio_close, pipe_close,
	struct string_output, string_out_put_string, string_out_put_char,
	string_out_vcformat, dir_get_line, make_string_output_stream,
	get_string_from-stream, make_dir_stream, get_line, get_char,
	vformat, vcformat, format, cformat, put_string, put_cstring,
	put_char, put_cchar, stream_init): Converted to wchar_t.

	* stream.h (vformat, format, put_cstring): Declarations updated.

	* txr.c  (version, progname, spec_file, oom_realloc_handler,
	help, hint, remove_hash_bang_line, main, txr_main): Converted
	to wchar_t.

	* txr.h (version, progname): Declarations updated.

	* unwind.c (uw_throw, uw_throwf, uw_errorf, type_mismatch,
	uw_register_subtype): Converted to wchar_t.

	* unwind.h (uw_throwf, uw_errorf, type_mismatch): Declarations updated.

	* utf8.c, utf8.h: New files.

2009-11-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	hash.c (hash_grow): Rewritten to avoid resizing the vector
	in place, and thus having to pulling all conses into a big list.
	TODO: avoid recomputing the hash function over the keys.
	We could enhance cons cells with two more fields without using
	additional storage.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Changing representation of objects to allow for unboxed characters.
	Now numbers and characters fit into a cell. We lose one more bit
	from the range of numbers.

	* lib.h (TAG_SHIFT, TAG_MASK, TAG_NUM, TAG_PTR, NUM_MASK, NUM_MIN,
	is_ptr, is_num):  Macros updated.
	(is_chr, tag): New macros.
	(struct chr): Removed.
	(union obj): Updated.

	* lib.c (typeof, equal, chr, chrp, c_chr, obj_print): Updated.

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Characters aren't pointers any longer;
	use abstract accessor.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Add hash removal.

	* hash.c (remhash): New function.

	* hash.h (remhash): Declared.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Add hash table growth.

	hash.c (hash_grow): New function.
	(l_gethash): Renamed to gethash_l. Increment count; if load
	factor gets to two, call hash_grow to double the size.

	hash.h (l_gethash): Declaration changed to gethash_l.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Changing representation of objects to allow the NUM type to be
	unboxed. If the lowest bit of the obj_t * pointer is 1, then
	the remaining bits are a number. A lot of assumptions are made:
	- the long type can be converted to and from a pointer
	- two's complement.
	- behavior of << and >> operators when the sign bit is involved.

	* lib.h (TAG_SHIFT, TAG_MASK, TAG_NUM, TAG_PTR, NUM_MASK, NUM_MIN,
	is_ptr, is_num, type): New macros.
	(struct num): Removed.
	(nao): Redefined, so that it doesn't have the numeric tag.

	* lib.c (typeof, type_check2, type_check3, car, car_l, cdr, cdr_l,
	equal, consp, atom, listp, num, c_num, nump, plus, minus,
	stringp, lazy_stringp, obj_print, obj_pprint): Fixed these
	functions to use the new number representation, and not to deference
	the obj_t * poitner if it is actually a number.
	(obj_init): Adjusted values of maxint and minint.

	* gc.c (mark_obj, gc_is_reachable): Avoid dereferencing numbers.

	* hash.c (ll_hash): Likewise.

	* match.c (match_line, do_output_line): Likewise.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	First cut at hash tables. One known problem is allocation during gc,
	due to use of boxed numbers for vector access.

	* gc.c (gc): Disable gc when doing garbage collection, in case
	something tries to allocate memory during gc, triggering a recursive
	gc, which would be very bad. Also, call the new function,
	hash_process_weak, in between the mark and sweep phases.
	(gc_is_reachable): New function.

	* gc.h (gc_is_reachable): Declared.

	* lib.c (hash_t): New symbol global.
	(acons_new_l): New function.
	(obj_init): New symbol interned.

	* lib.h (hash_t, acons_new_l): Declared.

	* hash.c, hash.h: New files.

	* Makefile: New target, hash.o.

	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Throw exception on stream error during close, or I/O operations.  This
	is needed for pipes that terminate abnormally or return failed
	termination. Pipe and stdio streams have an extra description field
	so they are printed in a readable way.

	* lib.c (process_error): New global defined.
	(obj_init): New symbol interned.
	(lazy_stream_func): Pass t to close_stream, so exception
	is thrown if the close fails.
	(lazy_stream_cons): Ditto.
	
	* lib.h (process_error): Declared.

	* match.c (complex_snarf): Pass new desr argument to make_stdio_stream
	and make_pipe_stream.

	* stream.c (strm_ops): New argument on close function pointer.
	(common_destroy): Close without throwing exception. For objects
	being finalized, we don't care if the close works or not; the
	program has shown that it doesn't care about the stream by
	letting it become unreachable, so we don't bother the program
	by throwing an exception.
	(stdio_handle): New struct.
	(stdio_stream_print, stdio_stream_destroy, stdio_stream_mark,
	stdio_maybe_read_error, stdio_maybe_write_error): New functions.
	(stdio_put_string, stdio_put_char, stdio_get_line, 
	stdio_get_char, stdio_vcformat, stdio_close): Updated to new
	handle format, and throw errors now.
	(stdio_ops, pipe_ops): Redirected to new functions stdio_stream_print,
	stdio_stream_destroy and stdio_stream_mark.
	(pipe_close): Updated to new handle format. Parses status from
	pclose and throws exceptions appropriate to the situation.
	(dir_close): Takes extra argument.
	(make_stdio_stream, make_pipe_stream): New argument added.
	(make_string_output_stream): Some casts added. 
	(close_stream): Pass new argument down to virtual function.
	(stream_init): Pass new argument to make_stdio_stream
	when creating streams for stdin, stdout and stderr.

	* stream.h (make_stdio_stream, make_pipe_stream, close_stream):
	Declarations updated.

	* txr.c (txr_main): Pass new argument to make_stdio_stream.

	* unwind.c (uw_init): Register process_error.

2009-11-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 020

	Improved documentation.

	Building via configure script.

	Support for cross compiling support.

	Support for building in separate build directory.

	Internal bugfixes.

	Portability bugs fixed; works on x86-64 GNU/Linux.

2009-11-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bug ID 27898: Directory order dependencies in test case.
	Converted some directories to text files.

	* tests/002/proc/*/task: Directories removed.

	* tests/002/proc/*/tasks: Files created.

	* tests/002/query-1.txr: Query updated.

	* tests/002/query-1.expected: Expected output updated.

2009-11-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bug ID 27895: Calls to protect have an argument list terminated
	by the integer constant 0 rather than a proper null pointer constant.

	lib.c (obj_init): Properly terminate argument list of protect call.

	stream.c (stream_init): Likewise.

	unwind.c (unwind_init): Likewise.

	txr.c (txr_main): two-argument protect calls rewritten using prot1.

2009-11-01  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bug ID 27899: Garbage collection problem: method of locating stack
	bottom is unreliable due to the unpredictable allocation order of local
	variables. The addresses of stack_bottom_0 and stack_bottom_1 variables
	do not necessarily bracket the others which means that some local
	variables in main can be out of the reach of the garbage collector:
	our stack bottom is wrongly in the middle of the frame.

	* lib.c (init): Removed one of the stack bottom parameters, so there
	is only one. This is passed straight down to gc_init.
	Also noticed that the oom_realloc variable was not being set
	from the oom parameter.

	* lib.h (init): Declaration updated.

	* txr.c (txr_main): New static function.
	(main): Calls init, and then txr_main. The idea is that txr_main
	should get fresh stack frame. So the stack_bottom variable in main
	should be outside of that stack frame.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (equal): Fix broken LSTR and FUN cases.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Got "make tests" working in separate build directory,
	with .out files going to local tests/ tree.

	* Makefile (depend): Refer to depend.txr and dep.mk
	using $top_srcdir; no need for symlinks.
	Changed a few more ./txr references to use $(PROG).
	(TESTS): Path munging to generate targets with local paths.
	(%.ok): Fixed diff logic to compare between .expected file
	in $(top_srcdir) and local .out file.

	* configure: Don't generate symlinks for tests and dep.mk.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Got "make install" working.

	* Makefile (install): New target.

	* configure (mandir, bindir): New variables.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Got build to work in separate build directory.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Added -I flag to point header inclusion to the
	source directory.
	(PROG): New variable to hold program name.
	(VPATH): Variable set, as a quick and dirty way to get GNU make
	to find the prerequisites back in the source directory.
	* configure: Added steps to symlink the tests directory and dep.mk.
	* depend.txr: Modified to generate the dependencies with
	correct references to the top_srcdir, with the exception of
	locally generated headers.
	* dep.mk: Regenerated.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Build configuration via configure script, with cross compiling support.
	(Tested by cross-compiling txr on an x86 GNU/Linux system
	to run on a MIPS-based GNU/Linux system).

	* configure: New script.
	* Makefile: (OPT_FLAGS, LANG_FLAGS, DIAG_FLAGS, DBG_FLAGS,
	LEX_DBG_FLAGS, TXR_DBG_OPTS, LEXLIB): Variables removed;
	these are now generated in config.make by configure.
	(config.make): New target to print friendlier diagnostic if
	the build is not configured.
	(distclean): New target to do clean, plus remove config.make.

2009-10-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (YY_INPUT): Kill tabs with spaces (how did they sneak in?).
	Fix possible use of uninitialized ch.

2009-10-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Fixed misleading wording (separation versus termination).
	Added Introduction headings to some major sections.
	Improved exception handling intro.

2009-10-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 019

	Regexps can be bound to variables.

	New freeform directive.

	* txr.c (version): Bump.
	* txr.1: Bump version and date.

	* lib.c, match.c, regex.c, regex.h, stream.c: Trailing whitespace
	removed from lines.

2009-10-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Documented freeform.

2009-10-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Change the freeform line catenation semantics to termination
	rather than separation.

	* lib.h (lazy_str): Declaration updated.

	* lib.c (lazy_str): Tack terminator onto initial prefix
	string. Parameter renamed. Also, terminator string cached
	in the object.
	(lazy_str_force, lazy_str_force_upto): Terminate, rather
	than separate.

	* match.c (match_files): sep variable renamed to term.

2009-10-21  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* gc.c (mark_obj): Bugfix: recurse over recently added
	member, opts, in the lazy_string structure.

2009-10-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Got regex working over lazy strings from freeform.

	Bugfixes.

	* lib.c (length_str): Fixed recursion to wrong length function.
	(lazy_str_force):  March down list properly. Update lazy
	string's limit value.

	* match.c (match_line): Convert to lazy-string-aware style; i.e.
	avoidance of triggering a force of the whole string.
	(match_files): Bugfix in argument processing of freeform directive.

	* regex.h (nfam_result_t): New typedef.
	(nfa_machine_reset): New function declaration.
	(nfa_machine_feed): Updated declaration.

	* regex.c (nfa_machine_init): Refactor to use nfa_machine_reset.
	(nfa_machine_feed): Return nfam_result_t rather than just int.
	(search_regex, match_regex): Refactor to work with lazy strings well.

2009-10-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Implement custom separator and limit in freeform.

	* lib.h (lazy_string): New struct member, opts.
	(lazy_str): Declaration updated.

	* lib.c (lazy_str): New constructor parameters to set the
	seprator string and numeric line limit.
	(lazy_str_force, lazy_str_upto): Honor the line limit,
	and use the separator string if provided.

	* match.c (match_files): Process the arguments for freeform
	directive.

2009-10-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (sub_str): Avoid invoking c_str which forces the
	lazy string.

2009-10-20  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Start of implementation for freestyle matching.

	Lazy strings implemented, incompletely.

	Changed string function to implicitly strdup; non-strdup
	version changed to string_own. Fixed wrong uses of strdup
	rather than chk_strdup.

	Functions added to regex module to provide regex matching
	as a state machine to which characters are fed.

	* lib.h (type_t): New enum member LSTR, for lazy strings.
	(lstr_t, freestyle, type_check3, string_own): Declared.
	(string): Parameter changed to const char *.
	(lazy_stringp, split_str, lazy_str, lazy_str_force_upto,
	lazy_str_force, lazy_str_get_trailing_list, length_str_gt,
	length_str_ge, length_str_lt, length_str_le): Declared.

	* lib.c (lstr_t, freestyle): New symbol globals.
	(code2type, obj_print, obj_pprint, equal): Extended to handle LSTR.
	(type_check3): New function.
	(string_own): New function; does what string used to do.
	(string): Duplicates the string with strdup, so callers don't have to.
	(mkstring, copy_str, trim_str): Use string_own.
	(stringp): A lazy string is a kind of string.
	(lazy_stringp): New function.
	(length_str, c_str, search_str, sub_str, chr_str,
	chr_str_set): Handle lazy strings.
	(split_str): New function.
	(lazy_str, lazy_str_force_upto, lazy_str_force,
	lazy_str_get_trailing_list, length_str_gt, length_str_ge,
	length_str_lt, length_str_le): New functions.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned. Eliminated strdup calls.
	
	* gc.c (finalize, mark_obj): Changed to handle LSTR type.
	Eliminated default case from switch so we get a gcc
	diagnostic if a case is not handled.

	* match.c (match_files): Eliminated strdup calls.
	Added freeform directive.

	* parser.y (grammar): Changed string calls to string_own.

	* stream.c (stdio_get_line, get_string_from_stream):
	Changed string calls to string_own.
	(dir_get_line): Eliminated chk_strdup call.

	* txr.c (remove_hash_bang_line, main): Eliminated strdup calls.

	nfa_machine_match_span): New functions declared.

	* regex.c (nfa_machine_init, nfa_machine_cleanup, nfa_machine_feed,
	nfa_machine_match_span): New functions defined.

2009-10-18  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Trivial change allows regexps to be bound to variables,
	and used for matching. This Just Works because of
	the way match_line treats variables.

	* match.c (eval_form): Check for a regexp form and return
	it as a value representing itself.
	* regex.c (regexp): New function.
	* regex.h (regexp): Declared.

2009-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* deps.mk: Updated.

2009-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 018

	Bugfixes: mistakes in debugging calls; infinite looping
	bug in collect; skip directive not advancing match
	by proper number of lines bug.

	* match.c (debuglcf): Cosmetic fix.
	(match_files): After recognizing nothrow in the file spec,
	replace it by a string. A few places expect first(files) to be
	a string. The skip directive must return whatever
	return value it obtained from the nested match_files call,
	and not substitute the current line number, so that the
	caller can proceed past the correct number of lines that
	were matched. Fixed obj_t * being passed to %s printf specifier
	in debug printf. Collect directive must make progress even
	if the nested spec makes no progress (returns successfully,
	but with the original line number).
	* txr.c (version): Bump.
	* txr.1: Bump version and date.
	* txr/tests/004/query-1.txr: New test case.
	* tests/004/query-1.expected: Expected result for new test case.

2009-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 017

	Bugfix in exception subtype definition (defex).

	Tail recursion in marking function of garbage collector.

	-f option for specifying query file, allowing more
	options to follow, useful in hash-bang scripting and
	other situations.

	* txr.c: (version): Bump to 016
	* txr.1: Bump version to 016.

2009-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Documented defex.
	* unwind.c (uw_register_subtype): Bugfix: if the subtype
	exists already, we must not delete it and create a new entry, but
	destructively point its entry to its assigned supertype.
	An exceptions is thrown rather than abort for attempts
	to make t a subtype of something other than itself.
	An attempt to make something other than nil a subtype of nil
	is diagnosed.  Attempts to redefine the relationship
	between two types if they are already connected by one;
	this covers circularity and other cases, while still allowing
	a relaxed order of definition.

2009-10-17  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* gc.c (mark_obj_tail): New macro.
	(mark_obj): Optimized with manual tail recursion.
	The funtion will no longer generate long call stacks
	for long lists. Descending to the car field of
	a cons is still recursive, but ``car-heavy''
	trees are rare.

2009-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Resurrect -f option, with different meaning.
	We need "-f query-file" so that hash-bang scripts
	can be written which can pass options to txr.

	* txr.c (help, main): Inplement and document -f.
	Also bugfix: do not throw file open errors as exceptions
	of type error, because these cause an abort, potentially leading to a
	core dump. They are now thrown as file_error.
	* txr.1: Documented -f.

2009-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Implemented @(next arg) for treating the command line
	as an input source.

	* txr.1: Updated, and fixed a few unrelated mistakes.
	* lib.c (dir): Removed unused symbol globa.
	(args): New symbol global.
	* lib.h (dir): Declaration removed.
	(args): Declared.
	match.c (match_files): Implemented @(next arg).
	Had to hack laziness to the file opening logic in match_files.
	If the function is entered with a spec whose first
	directive is @(next), then it defers opening the first
	file in the list of files (since it will be immediately
	abandoned in favor of another input source).
	This prevents an error in the situation when the
	arguments do not name files, and there is a @(next args)
	directive to process them as an input source.

2009-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 016

	Catch clauses with parameters.

	Directive for throwing exceptions: throw.

	Directive for defining exception types: defex.

	-f option renamed to -c.

	* txr.c: (version): Bump to 016
	* txr.1: Bump version to 016.

2009-10-16  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.c (help, main): Changed -f argument to -c. This
	is consistent with the -c argument of the shell;
	-f looks like awk's -f option, which specifies a file,
	not a literal script body.

	* txr.1: Updated.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: Grammar, spelling.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.y (clauses_opt): Long overdue nonterminal added.
	(define_clause) simplified with clauses_opt.
	(try_clause): Error handling improved.
	(catch_clauses_opt): Catch and finally clauses can be empty.
	Error cases added.
	* txr.1: Updated.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Use alist_remove1 for a one
	element removal.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* unwind.c (uw_throw): Add program prefix before
	unhandled exception text. Print it in the
	standard notation if it's not a string literal.
	* match.c (sem_error, file_err): Don't stick program
	prefix into exception text.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* unwind.c (uw_exception_subtype_p, uw_init):
	Slight change in representation for exception subtypes,
	saving one node in the list.

2009-10-15  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New throw and defex directives, catches with arguments.

	* lib.c (defex, throw): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): Symbols interned.
	* lib.h (defex, throw): Declared.
	* match.c (match_files): Implemented throw and defex.
	Argument handling in catches.
	* unwind.c (uw_register_subtype): Returns right
	argument, so we can cleverly use it with reduce_left.
	* unwind.h (uw_register_subtype): Declaration updated.
	* txr.1: Updated.

2009-10-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 015

	Code restructuring.

	Corruption bugfix in gc-debugging code.

	The nil symbol more properly implemented.

	Semantics change: collect treated as a failed match if it
	does not collect anything.

	Bugfix in function argument reconciliation: must only
	be done for unbound parameters.

	New @(local) directive (synonym of forget) for expressing
	local variables in functions.

	Quasi-literals: backquote-delimited literals that contain interpolated
	variables. Useful in next, output, bind and function calls.

	Hygiene: some implementation-inserted syntax tree elements
	are now in their own namespace so they can't clash with user-defined
	constructs.

	Rewritten streams implementation.

	Exception handling: try/catch/finally.

	Exceptions used internally and externally.

	File errors are mapped to exceptions now.

	Hash bang (#!) scripting supported.

	New -f paramater, allowing entire query to be specified
	as argument rather than from a file or stdin.

	* txr.c: (version): Bump to 014.
	* txr.1: Bump version to 014. More documentation about
	exceptions.

2009-10-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Support for hash bang execution, and embedding query
	in a command line argument.

	* txr.c (remove_hash_bang_line): New function.
	(main): Added -f option. Initialize and gc-protect yyin_stream, and
	use it in all places where yyin was previously set up.
	Diagnose when -a, -D and -f are wrongly clumped with other options.
	Remove the first line of the query if it starts with #!.
	* parser.h (yyin): Declaration removed.
	(yyin_stream): Declared.
	* parser.l (YY_INPUT): Macro defined.
	(yyin_stream): New global.
	* stream.c (string_in_get_line, string_in_get_char): Bugfix:
	wrong length function used.
	(string_in_ops): Bugfix: wrong get_char function wired in.
	(get_char): New function.
	* stream.h (get_char): Declared.
	* txr.1: -f option documented.

2009-10-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (obj_print, obj_pprint): Print #<garbage ...>
	syntax if an object has a bad type code; do not just return
	without printing anything.

2009-10-14  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Code cleanup and documentation.

	* txr.1: Start documenting quasiliterals, exception handling and
	nothrow in next and output.
	* parser.y (catch_clauses_opt): Add missing empty production, so that
	a try block doesn't have to have a finally clause.
	* lib.h (or2, or3, or4): New macros.
	* match.c (match_files): Allow output and next forms which just
	have one argument that is nothrow, as documented.
	* stream.c common_vformat, string_out_vcformat, string_out_vcformat,
	make_string_output_stream, make_dir_stream, close_stream, get_line,
	vformat, vcformat, format, cformat, put_string, put_cstring,
	put_char): Switch to new style type assertions.

2009-10-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New syntax for next and output directives, taking advantage
	of quasi-literals. Non-throwing behavior can be specified in
	both using nothrow. The old syntax is supported, and has
	the old semantics (non-throwing). Hence, the test cases
	pass again without modification.

	File open errors thrown as file_error type.

	* lib.c (nothrow, file_error): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned.
	* lib.h (nothrow, file_error): Declared.
	* match.c (file_err): New function.
	(eval_form): Bugfix: if input is nil, or an atom other than a symbol,
	return the value hoisted into a cons. A nil return strictly means,
	unbound variable.
	(match_files): Support new syntax for next and and output.
	Throw open errors as file_err.
	* parser.l (grammar): Change how OUTPUT is returned to the
	style similar to DEFINE, so interior forms can be parsed.
	* parser.y (grammar): Fix up output_clause with new syntax.
	* unwind.c (uw_throw): Do not abort on unhandled file_error,
	but terminate with a failed status.
	(uw_init): Register file_error as a subtype of error exception.

2009-10-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	First cut at working try/catch/finally implementation.

	* lib.c (try, catch, finally): New symbol globals.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned.
	* lib.h (try, catch, finally: Declared.
	* parser.y (TRY, CATCH, FINALLY): New tokens.
	(try_clause, catch_clauses_opt): New nonterminal grammar symbols.

	(uw_catch_begin): Macro rewritten to use switch logic
	around setjmp.
	(uw_do_unwind, uw_catch, uw_unwind): New macros.
	(uw_catch_end): Rewritten to close switch, and automatically
	continue the unwinding if the block is entered as an unwind.
	* unwind.c (uw_unwind_to_exit_point): Exception catching
	frames made invisible via new flag prior to control passing to them.
	longjmp code 2 introduced for distinguishing a catch from
	an unwind. Visibility flag is checked and invisible frames
	are skipped.
	(uw_push_catch): cont member of the unwind frame initialized to zero.
	(exception_subtype_p): Renamed to uw_exception_subtype_p, changed
	to extern. Fixed wrong order of arguments to assoc.
	(uw_throw): Honor visibility flag: do not consider invisible
	catch frames.
	(uw_register_subtype): sup/sub mixup bugfix.
	(uw_continue): Takes extra argument: the continuation frame
	that (re)establishes the exit point for the unwinding.
	This allows nested unwinding action to take place in a finally,
	and then to continue to the original exit point.
	* match.c (match_files): Handling for try directive added.

2009-10-13  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* parser.l (yybadtoken): Bugfix: added missing LITCHAR case.
	* unwind.h (internal_error): Fixed broken macro.
	* match.c (match_line, match_files): sem_error bugfix: used %a instead
	of ~a.
	(match_files): Wrap block handler in compound statement, otherwise the
	macroexpansion declares a variable in the middle of a statement, which
	is a gcc extension to C90 (or a C99 feature,
	but we aren't using C99).

2009-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Exception handling for query errors.
	Verbose logging decoupled from yyerror functions.

	debuglf, debuglcf for logging and sem_error for throwing
	query errors as exceptions.
	* parser.h (spec_file_str): New global declared.
	* parser.l (yyerror): Calls yyerrorf instead of yyerrorlf;
	lets yyerrorf increment error count.
	(yyerrorf): Loses level argument.
	(yyerrorlf): Function removed.
	(yybadtoken): Retargetted from yyerrorlf to yyerrorf.
	(grammar): yyerrorf call fixed up.
	* txr.c (spec_file_str): New global defined.
	(main): Protects new global against gc, and initializes it.
	* unwind.c (uw_throw): If an unhandled exception is of
	type query_error, it results in an exit rather than abort.
	The false string is conditionally printed.
	(uw_init): Register query_error as subtype of error.

2009-10-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Exception handling framework implemented.

	* lib.c (cobj_t, error, type_error, internal_err, numeric_err,
	range_err): New symbol globals.
	(prog_string): New string global.
	(code2type): New static function.
	(typeof): Rewritten using code2type.

	chr_str_set, apply, funcall, funcall1, funcall2,
	vec_get_fill, vecref_l, lazy_stream_cons): Checks and
	assertions rewritten using new functions and macros.
	(obj_init): prog_string protected from gc.
	New symbols interned.
	(init): uw_init() call moved after obj_init() because
	it needs stable symbols.
	* lib.h (cobj_t, error, type_error, internal_err, numeric_err,
	range_err, prog_string, type_check, type_check2): Declared.
	* match.c (dump_var, complex_snarf, complex_close): abort

	* stream.h (get_string_from_stream): Declared.
	* txr.c (main): Some error prints turned to throws.
	* unwind.c (unwind_to_exit_point): Supports UW_CATCH frames,
	whose finalization logic has to be invoked during unwinding,
	and as target exit points.
	(uw_init): Installs exception symbols into
	subtyping hirearchy.
	(uw_push_catch, exception_subtype_p, uw_throw, uw_throwf,

	uw_register_subtype, uw_continue): New functions declared.
	(uw_catch_begin, uw_catch_end, internal_error, type_assert,
	bug_unless, numeric_assert, range_bug_unless): New macros.

2009-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Rewritten streams implementation.

	* stream.h, stream.c: New files.
	* Makefile (OBJS): New object file stream.o.
	* dep.mk: Dependencies updated.
	* gc.c (finalize): STREAM case removed.  Call destroy only if not null.
	(mark_obj): STREAM case removed.
	* lib.c (push, pop): New functions.
	(equal): STREAM case removed.
	(sub_str): Allow from parameter to be nil, defaulting to zero.
	(stdio_line_read, stdio_line_write, stdio_close, stdio_line_stream,
	pipe_close, pipe_line_stream, dirent_read, dirent_close,
	dirent_stream, stream_get, stream_pushback, stream_put,
	stream_close): Functions removed.

	(lazy_stream_func, lazy_stream_cons): Retargetted to new streams.
	(cobj_print_op): Likewise.
	(init): Disables and restores GC, instead of doing it in obj_init.
	(obj_print): Retargetted to new streams.

	(obj_init): Does not manipulate gc_state any more, moved to init.
	Call to stream_init added.

	stream_pushback, stream_put, stream_close, snarf_line): Removed.
	(cobj_print_op, dump, snarf): Modified.
	* match.c (dump_bindings, complex_snarf): Retargetted to new streams.
	* txr.c (main): format used to dump bindings and specs in verbose mode.

2009-10-07  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Implemented quasi-literals: string literals which may
	contain variables to be interpolated.

	Also, took care of a hygiene problem with respect to some
	parser-generated forms, which must be invisible to the user.

	* Makefile (LEX_DB_FLAGS): New variable; helpful
	in generating a lexical analyzer with debug tracing.
	* parser.l (nesting, closechar): Static variables removed.
	(char_esc): Add \` escape for quasi-literals.
	(stack): New %option, to generate a scanner which has
	a start condition stack.
	(QSILIT): New start condition.
	(grammar): Refactored to use start condition stacks.
	Quasi-literal lexical analysis added.
	* parser.y (lit_char_helper): New function, for factoring out
	some common logic between string literals and quasi literals.
	(quasilit, quasi_item, quasi_items): New grammar symbols and
	production rules.
	(strlit): Rule shortened with new helper function.
	Bugfix: error case assigns nil to $$.
	(chrlist): Bugfix: error case assigns nil to $$.
	(LITCHAR): Added to %prec table to fix shift-reduce problem.
	(expr): Production now can generate a quasilit.
	* lib.c (quasi): New symbol global.
	(obj_init): Intern quasi as "$quasi", so the user can
	make a function called quasi.  Also, var and regex are now interned
	with the names "$var" and "$regex" for the same reason.
	* lib.h (quasi): Declared.
	* match.c (eval_form): Rewritten with recursive processing
	to handle deeply embedded variables, as well as quasi-strings.
	(subst_vars): Handles quasi-strings.
	(match_files): Function calls now use eval_form for function
	argument evaluation, except of course in the special case that if an
	argument is a symbol, it may be unbound.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): No error message for merging to
	a symbol which is already bound; the existing behavior
	is to destructively update the binding, which is useful,
	and so the error is pointless.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Introduce local as synonym to forget. It does exactly the
	same thing; a previous binding is forgotten. This spelling
	is nicer for functions.
	* lib.h (local): Declared.
	* lib.c (local): Defined.
	(obj_init): New symbol interned.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bugfix: function parameter reconciliation (after function call
	completes) must only consider the unbound parameters.
	Otherwise false mismatches result if the function destructively
	manipulated some bindings of bound parameters.
	E.g. @(define foo (a)) is called as @(foo "bar") and internally
	it rebinds bound parameter a to "baz". This situation is
	not a mismatch. The rebinding is thrown away.

	* match.c (match_files): When processing a function call,
	keep an alist which associates arguments and unbound parameters.
	Then, after the function call, process the alist, rather
	than the full parameter list.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Semantics change: collect fails if it does not collect
	anything. Non-failing behavior can be obtained by
	wrapping with @(maybe) (but no such workaround for coll yet).

	* match.c (match_line): Return nil if coll collected nothing.
	(match_files): Return nil if collect collected nothing.


2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Bugfix: nil must be on the list of interned symbols.

	* lib.c (sym_name): Function removed. This was like
	symbol_name but did not accept nil.
	(intern): Use symbol_name instead of sym_name, allowing
	nil to be on the list of interned symbols.
	(obj_init): Add nil to interned_syms list.
	(nil_string): Changed from "NIL" to "nil".
	* match.c (dest_bind): Treat nil as a value, not a symbol.
	(match_files): Treat nil as a value when it's
	a function argument.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* gc.c (more): Bugfix: free_tail was incorectly calculated,
	thereby destroying the validity of the FIFO recycling algorithm
	used when GC debugging is enabled. This showed up as mysterious
	assertions and crashes.
	(mark_obj): Do not abort if a free object is marked.
	(mark_mem_region): Renamed bottom and top variables to low
	and high. The naming was confusing inverted relative
	to that in the caller.
	(sweep): Abort if somehow a block is free and marked reachable.

2009-10-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* match.c (match_files): Fixed nonexitent symbol warning for merge
	directive (complained about wrong symbol).

	Refactoring matching code.

	* lib.h (cobj_ops): New function pointer, mark.
	* gc.c (mark_obj): For a COBJ type, call the mark function
	if the pointer is non-null.
	(gc_mark): New public function, wrapper that calls
	the private mark_obj. Implementations of mark for COBJ
	objects will need to call this.
	* gc.h (mark_obj): Declared.
	* regex.c (regex_obj_ops): Explicitly initialize mark function pointer
	 to null.

2009-10-05  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Code restructuring.

	* Makefile (match.o): New object file.
	(depend): New rule for generating dep.mk, using txr.
	(lib.o, lex.yy.o, regex.o, y.tab.o unwind.o, txr.o, match.o, gc.o):
	Dependency rules removed.
	* dep.mk: New make include file; captures dependencies. Generated
	by new depend rule in Makefile, using txr.
	* depend.txr: Txr query to generate dependencies.
	* extract.y: File renamed to parser.y
	(output_produced): Variable removed,
	moved into new file match.c.
	(dump_shell_string, dump_shell_string, dump_var, dump_bindings, depth,
	weird_merge, map_leaf_lists, dest_bind, eval_form, match_line,
	format_field, subs_vars, complex_open, complex_open_failed,
	complex_close, complex_snarf, robust_length, bind_car, bind_cdr,
	extract_vars, extract_bindings, do_output_line, do_output,
	match_files, extract): Functions removed, added to match.c.
	(struct fpip): Definition removed, added to match.c
	(<stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <ctype.h>, <errno.h>, <setjmp.h>,
	"gc.h", "unwind.h"): Unneeded headers removed.
	* match.c: New file.
	* extract.l: Renamed to parser.l.
	* extract.h: Renamed to parser.h.
	(opt_loglevel, opt_nobindings, opt_arraydims, version, progname):
	Declarations moved to txr.h.
	(extract): Dclaration moved to match.h.
	* txr.h, match.h: New headers.
	* gc.h (opt_gc_debug): Moved to txr.h.

	Support for query-defined functions.

	* extract.l (yybadtoken): New DEFINE case.
	(NESTED): New flex start condition.  This allows for different lexing
	rules in nested lists, so even though for instance @(collect) is a
	special token @((collect)) isn't.

2009-10-02  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Misc. bugfixes and improvements.

	* extract.l (grammar): Newline in a directive
	no longer an error. Why not allow it.
	* extract.y (grammar): Productions for catching empty bodies in some
	constructs now end with END newl, rather
	than just END, so parsing can continue sanely.
	(match_lines): In diagnostics, don't say "ignored" about material which
	causes an error that fails the query!
	* lib.c (mkstring): Initialize length since we know it!
	(c_str): Take a symbol as an arg, so we don't have
	to keep writing c_str(symbol_name(sym)).
	(obj_print): Use isprint rather than isctrl to decide
	whether to print a character as an escape.
	(snarf_line): Properly handle EOF in the middle of line.

2009-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 013

	Some minor garbage collection issues fixed.

	Infinite looping bug fixed.

	New @(trailer) directive.

	* extract.y (match_files): Implemented trailer directive.
	* extract.l (version): Bump to 013.
	* lib.h (trailer): Declaration added.
	* lib.c (trailer): External definition added.
	(obj_init): Initializer trailer with interned symbol.
	* txr.1: Documented @(trailer) and bumped version to 013.

2009-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Looping bug fixed. Certain directives could cause an infinite
	loop if the query has run out of data.

	* extract.y (match_files): The semantics of the first_file_parsed
	argument changes a little bit. Previously, if nil was passed,
	a new lazy stream would be opened for the first file.
	But this is ambiguous because nil also means empty list;
	sometimes when we recurse into match_files, the data has ran
	out and this argument is thus nil. Now, that argument must be
	the symbol t in order to mean ``open the first file''.
	If the argument is nil, it unambiously means ``we are at the end of the
	current file; don't open anything''.
	(extract): The initial call to match_files now passes
	the symbol t for the first_file_parsed argument.

2009-09-29  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Fixing some gc issues. The test cases were found to bomb
	with an assertion when run with --gc-debug enabled,
	due to a garbage-collected object still being used.
	This was due to the way the main function was structured.

	Also, the stack ``top'' terminology in the gc was stupidly wrong. Leaf
	function frames are at the stack top, and main is near the bottom.
	I was thinking of the ``top caller''.

	* Makefile (TXR_DBG_OPTS): New variable.
	Tests are now run with --gc-debug, which makes them slower,
	but has much greater chance of trapping gc problems.
	* extract.l (main): Two variables are now used for determining the
	stack bottom. We don't know in which order the compiler
	places local variables into a stack frame.  (This is a separate
	question from that of the direction of stack growth).
	The call to the init function is now done right away.
	The argument processing section of main does some processing
	with GC objects, but the init function was being called afterward,
	before the list of interned symbols is protected from garbage
	collection! So with --gc-debug turned on, parts of the interned
	symbol list were being garbage collected (since the variable
	has not yet been added to the set of root pointers, which is
	done in the init function).  Also, the use of an unknown --long-option
	is diagnosed properly now.
	* gc.c (gc_stack_top): Renamed to gc_stack_bottom, and converted from
	extern to static.
	(mark): Follows rename of gc_stack_top to gc_stack_bottom.
	(sweep): Eliminated the freed variable for counting freed objects,
	and the associated debug message, which was not useful.
	Commented why the free list is managed differently when dbg
	is turned on.
	(gc_init): New function.
	* gc.h (gc_stack_top): Declaration removed.
	(gc_init): Declaration added.
	* lib.c (min): New macro.
	(init): Takes two additional arguments which are used to
	determine the stack bottom. The function first determiens
	whether the stack grows up or down. Then it takes the
	greater or smaller of the two potential stack top pointers,
	based on that. The result is passed go gc_init.
	* lib.h (init): Declaration updated.

2009-09-28  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 012

	Semantics change of @(until) in @(collect) and @(coll).

	Minor fixes.

	* extract.y (match_line, match_files): The until clauses
	continue to be processed after the main clauses of the collect
	or coll (to see the bindings), but are processed before
	the collection occurs, so that the until will veto
	the bindings of the last iteration.  Moreover, the data
	positions stays where it is when this happens, and no
	arrangement is made to match the until material again.

	* txr.1: Tried to document the change.


2009-09-27  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* txr.1: following proofread, fixed various escaping problems and
	instances of missing text.

2009-09-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* lib.c (equal): Bugfixes: wrong fallthrough of FUN case.
	VEC case must return nil, not break.

2009-09-26  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Preparation for some sorting support.

	* extract.y (merge): Renamed to weird_merge.
	(map_leaf_lists): New functino.
	(match_file): Follow weird_merge rename.
	* lib.c (all_satisfy, none_satisfy, string_lt, do_bind2other,
	bind2other, merge, do_sort, sort): New functions.
	* lib.h (all_satsify, none_satisfy, string_lt,
	bind2other, sort): Declared.

2009-09-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 011

	New @(maybe) clause optionally matches (does not fail if none of
	its clauses match anything).

	New blocks feature: allows a query or subquery to be
	abruptly terminated by invoking an exit to a named or anonymous
	block. @(collect) and @(skip) have implicit anonymous blocks now.

	The @(skip) directive takes a numeric argument now, which limits
	how many lines are searched.

	* Makefile, extract.l, extract.y, extract.h, gc.c, gc.h, lib.c, lib.h,
	regex.c, regex.h, txr.1, unwind.c, unwind.h: Copyright notice and
	license text updated or added, and version bumped up to 011.
	* tests/001/query-1.txr, tests/001/query-2.txr, tests/001/query-3.txr,
	tests/002/query-1.txr: Assigned to public domain.

2009-09-25  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New features:
	- named blocks;
	- maybe clause;
	- optional iteration bound on skip.

	* extract.y: includes added: "unwind.h", <setjmp.h>.
	(MAYBE, OR): New grammar tokens.
	(maybe_clause): New nonterminal grammar symbol.
	(expr): A NUMBER can be an expression now, so that @(skip 42)
	is valid syntax.
	(match_files): Support for numeric argument in skip directive
	to bound the search to a maximum number of lines.
	Anonymous block established around skip.
	New directives implemented: maybe, block, accept and fail.
	Anonymous block established around collect.
	* txr.1: Documentation updated with new features.
	* Makefile: new object file unwind.o, and associated rules.
	* extract.l (yybadtoken): New cases for MAYBE and OR.
	(grammar): Likewise.
	* lib.c (block, fail, accept): New symbol variables.
	(obj_init): New symbols interned.
	* lib.h (block, fail, accept): Declared.
	(if2, if3): Macros fixed so test expression is not compared to nil,
	but implicitly tested as boolean.
	* unwind.c, unwind.h: New source files.

2009-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Stability fixes.

	* extract.y (match_files): Fixed invalid string("-") to
	string(chk_strdup("-")) which caused a freeing of
	a non-malloced string at gc finalization time.
	* regex.c (nfa_state_shallow_free): New function: does not
	free satellite objects, just the structure itself.
	(nfa_combine): Use nfa_state_shallow_free instead of nfa_state_free,
	because the merged state inherits ownership of objects from the state
	being spliced out.
	(nfa_state_set): Fix lack of initialization of s.visited member of the
	state structure.

2009-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 010

	A file specs can start with $, which means read a directory.

	Data sources are not into memory at once, but on demand,
	which can reduce memory for many queries.

	Regular expressions are now compiled once, when the
	query is parsed.

	Character escapes are now supported in regular expressions,
	and as a special syntax.

	* extract.l (version): Bumped to 010.
	(grammar): 8 and 9 are not octal digits; handle all regex
	backslash escaping in lexical grammar.
	* extract.y (grammar): Get rid of backslash handling from
	regex grammar. Lexer returns a REGCHAR for every escaped
	item. In situations where an operator character is implicily
	literal, like * in a character class, we use the grammar
	to include that alongside REGCHAR. Bugfixes: the character ], when not
	closing a class, is not a syntax error but stands for itself;
	the character - stands for itself outside of character class;
	the | character is literal in a character class.
	* txr.1: Updated version. Documented character escapes.

2009-09-24  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Lazy stream list improvement: no extra NIL element caused
	by end-of-file. Requires push-back support in streams.
	To avoid introducing a new structure member into streams,
	we extend the semantics of the label member, and rename
	it to label_pushback.

	* lib.c (stdio_line_stream, pipe_line_stream,
	dirent_stream): Follow rename of struct stream member;
	assert that label is an atom.
	(stream_get): Check pushback stack first and get item from there.
	(stream_pushback): New function.
	(lazy_stream_func): Pull one more item from the stream and
	use /that/ to decide whether to continue the lazy stream.
	The extra item is pushed back, if valid.
	(lazy_stream_cons): Simplified: no hack involving regular cons. Starts
	the induction by peeking into the stream. If something is there, it is
	pushed back, and a lazy cons is constructed which will fetch it.
	(obj_print): Made aware of the pushback, which must be skipped
	to get to the terminating label.
	* lib.h (struct stream): Member renamed from label to label_pushback.
	(stream_pushback): New function declaration.

2009-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Escape syntax in regexes, and text. The
	standard seven character escapes are supported,
	namely \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, and \r,
	as well as hex and octal escapes, plus
	the code \e for ASCII ESC.

	* extract.l (char_esc, num_esc): New functions.
	(grammar): New lex cases.
	* lib.c (obj_print): Support all character escapes in printing.
	Bugfix: backslash printed as two backslashes, not one.

2009-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* tests/002/query-1.txr: Modified to use $ to scan thread
	subdirectories.
	* tests/002/query-1.expected: Updated.

2009-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New COBJ type for wrapping arbitrary C objects into the
	Lisp-like framework. Compiled regexes are objects now.
	Regexes in a query are now compiled just once.

	* extract.y (grammar): Regexes compiled while parsing.
	(match_line): Modify with respect to the abstract syntax
	tree change, and the interface changes in the match_regex,
	and search_regex functions.
	* gc.c (mark_obj, finalize): Handle marking and finalization
	of COBJ objects.
	* lib.c (typeof, equal, obj_print): Handle COBJ.
	(cobj, cobj_print_op): New functions.
	* lib.h (type_t): New enum element, COBJ.
	(struct cobj, struct subj_ops): New types.
	(union obj): New member, co.
	(cobj, cobj_print_op): New functions declared.
	* regex.c (regex_equal, regex_destroy, regex_compile, regex_nfa): New
	functions.
	(regex_obj_ops): New static struct.
	(search_regex, match_regex): Interface change. Regex arguments
	are now compiled regexes. Functions won't handle raw regexes.
	* regex.h (regex_compile, regex_nfa): New functions declared.

2009-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	New feature: file specs that start with $ read directories.
	Reading from an ``ls'' pipe is too slow.

	Streams and lazy conses implemented. Lazy conses allow us to treat a
	file or other kind of stream exactly as if it were a list.
	We can use car and cdr, etc. But only the parts of the list
	that we actually touch are instantiated on-the-fly by
	reading from the underlying stream.

	* extract.l: inclusion of <dirent.h> added.
	* extract.l: inclusion of <dirent.h> added.
	* extract.y (fpip_closedir): new enumeration in struct fpip,
	and fpip_noclose removed.
	(complex_open): Check for leading $, use opendir.
	(complex_open_failed): New function.
	(complex_close): Handle fpip_closedir case. Not closing
	stdin and stdout is handled by explicit comparison now.
	(complex_snarf): New function, constructs stream of
	a suitable type, over object returned from complex_close,
	wraps it in a lazy list.
	(match_files): Use complex_snarf instead of snarf to get a lazy list.
	* gc.c: Handle LCONS and STREAM cases.
	* lib.c (stream_t, lcons_t): New variables holding symbols.
	(typeof, equal, obj_print): Handle LCONS and STREAM.
	(car, cdr, car_l, cdr_l, consp, atom, listp): Rewritten to handle
	LCONS.
	(chk_strdup, stdio_line_read, stdio_line_write, stdio_close
	stdio_line_stream, pipe_close, pipe_line_stream,
	dirent_read, dirent_close, dirent_stream,
	stream_get, stream_put, stream_close,
	make_lazycons, lazy_stream_func, lazy_stream_cons): New functions.
	(stdio_line_stream_ops, pipe_line_stream_ops,
	dirent_stream_ops): New static structs.
	(obj_init): Intern new symbols lstream, lcons, and dir.
	* lib.h (type_t): New enum members STREAM and LCONS.
	(struct stream, struct stream_ops, struct lazy_cons): New types.
	(union obj): New members sm and lc.
	(chk_strdup, stdio_line_stream, pipe_line_stream,
	dirent_stream, stream_get, stream_put, stream_close,
	lazy_stream_cons): New function declarations.
	* regex.c: inclusion of <dirent.h> added

2009-09-23  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	Version 009

	User-friendly error messages from parser.
	Fixed -q option.

	* extract.l (version): Bumped to 009.
	* txr.1: Updated version.

2009-09-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (LIBLEX): New variable.
	Refer to lex library as -lfl, using variable
	that can be overridden.

2009-09-22  Kaz Kylheku  <kkylheku@gmail.com>

	* extract.h (yybadtoken): New function declaration.
	* extract.l (yybadtoken): New function.
	(main): Fixed -q option.
	* extract.y (grammar): Lots of new error productions, some
	phrase rules refactored, resulting in much more user-friendly
	error diagnosis.
	* txr.1: -q option semantics clarified.
